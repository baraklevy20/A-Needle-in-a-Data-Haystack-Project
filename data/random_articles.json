        "Experiments aimed at examining the effect of aqueous extracts of three weed species on nodulation and nodule function of soybean cv. Melrose have been carried out at the Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biotechnology, Department of Agronomy and Soil Science, University of New England, Australia. Aqueous extracts of fresh weed material (Amaranthus powellii, Cyperus rotundus and Paspalum dilatatum) at the concentration of 10% (w/v) were added to a minus-nitrogen Hoagland’s nutrient solution in which the soybean plants were grown with 14 hours day length, day and night temperatures of 28 and 20°C, respectively, light intensity of 790 mol/m2/s, and the relative humidity of 65%. The plants were kept for three weeks prior to the measurement of activity of nitrogenase enzyme and ammonium content of the root nodules. All weed extracts tested resulted in impairment of soybean nodulation and nodule function as indicated by reduced activity of nitrogenase enzyme activity (acetylene reduction assay - ARA). Although amaranth extract was most inhibitory to the nitrogenase enzyme activity, it was less inhibitory than nutgrass extract in reducing the total ammonium content of the soybean root nodules.",
        "Obtaining virus free fruit planting material, conservation and utilization for large scale production of certified fruit trees, was and is still an objective demand. It knows already that significant cultural performances achieved by fruit trees, are direct related to the biological value of planting material used. Often it is necessary to introduce rapidly in culture new varieties and, this it is possible through tissue culture. Tissue culture is commonly called \"cloning\" or \"micropropagation\". In horticulture, the micropropagation is the most recent method used for the commercial plant propagation as a biotechnology application. At Research Institute for Fruit Growing Pitesti Argeş strawberry was one of the first plant species introduced in the in vitro culture.  In the `90, extensive research in many other fruit species, have to develop rapid and efficient procedures for mass clonal propagation. Also, sustained efforts are towards the development and verifying of biotechnology procedures for efficient propagation of the new created fruit varieties.  Propagation systems approved by actual legislation regarding production of fruit tree planting material include also micropropagation as propagation technique. Data presented in this paper describe validated protocols for micropropagation of some varieties of strawberry and raspberry. These protocols tested had favorable results for more than five years and can thus be considered validated. This paper presents the data regarding aseptic cultures establishment, culture media, hormone combinations, culture conditions and specific technical parameters for fruit species and the role and importance of tissue culture in certification schemes.

        "A breeding program of Mango (Mangifera indica) was organized by a team of Brawijaya University since 2006 by cross pollination between  Arumanis 143 (green skin) with yellow skin cvs. of Carabao, Haden, Podang and Swarnarika in vice versa. As early identification a molecular evaluation was conducted . Measurement were on carotene content, DNA analysis using PCR and sequencing. The result showed that mango cultivars having orange or yellowish  skin contain β carotene higher than those mango cultivar having green skin. SCAR18 marker as a sign on the presence of beta  (B) locus in tomato was not related with the differences of beta carotene accumulation in those manggo cultivars. SCAR18 marker that was amplified in mango produced specific amplimer of 320 bp in length. The similarity of SCAR18320 sequence obtaining by sequences alignment among five parental cultivars and 12 hybrids was up to 100%. SCAR18320 sequences that were generated by SCAR18 markers as predicted beta (B) loci had no significant similarity with sequences database relating to beta (B) gene in NCBI. SCAR18320 match to 19 Ty3-gypsy retrotransposons and others sequences related transcriptional regulator in more dissimilar sequences (discontiguous megablast) category. ",

        "Polygalacturonase inhibitory protein (PGIP) was extracted from Shinli pear tissue, purified\r\nand partially characterized. Extraction was carried out at 4oC with a high ionic strength extraction\r\nbuffer. After dialysis and concentration by ultrafiltration, the extract was chromatographed on\r\nsize-exclusion chromatography (S-100), and its active fractions were applied on concanavalin\r\nA-Sepharose. The PGIP activity was bound by the lectin, and then eluted using 1M α-methyl\r\nmannopyranoside, resulting in a 18-fold purification of the PGIP and demonstrating its\r\nglycoprotein nature. The following ion-exchange chromatography gave a PGIP that was 360-fold\r\npurified relative to the initial tissue extract, and having a 45kDa molecular weight, as estimated by\r\nSDS-PAGE electrophoresis. PGIP inhibitory activity was tested against A. niger, C. acutatum and B.\r\ncinerea. The radial diffusion and reducing sugar assays showed that PGIP inhibitory to three PGs\r\nwas affected by pH. In vivo tests revealed that PGIP inhibited three polygalacturonase from all\r\nthree fungi. Heated for 20 min at 85oC, the inhibitory activity of PGIP was reduced by 85-90%, and it\r\nwas completely suppressed after being heated at 100oC for 20 min. ",
        "Factors involved in the mechanism of soybean resistance to pod sucking bug R. linearis  were identified using resistant soybean genotypes, IAC-100, and IAC-80-596-2 and the susceptible variety, Wilis as a check. The role of trichomes in resistance was assayed removing trichomes from the pod shell, and seed coat  and  the resistance was determined based on the number of stylet punctures made by the bug. Seed of IAC-100 and IAC-596-2 that had longer, denser trichomes, higher crude fiber content and  suffered fewer stylet punctures than  Wilis. This suggested that denser and longer trichomes interfered with stylet piercing of the pod shell. When the trichomes of IAC-100 and IAC-596-2 were removed these genotypes were more susceptible to insect feeding. In further studies, replacement of IAC-100 and IAC-596-2 seed with seed of Wilis in the pods of resistant genotypes resulted less stylet punctures on the Wilis seed. It was concluded that denser and longer trichomes on pods along with harder pod shells acts as a physical barrier in antixenosis resistance of soybean to the pod sucking bug. Therefore, IAC-100, and IAC-596-2 genotypes have good potential for used as resistant parents in a soybean breeding program.    ",

        "This paper investigates the use of multi spectral satellite data for cropping pattern monitoring in paddy field. The southern coastal of Citarum watershed, West Java Province was selected as study sites. The analysis used in this study is identifying crop pattern based on growth stages of wetland paddy and other crops by investi-gating the characteristic of Normalized Differen-ce Vegetation Indices (NDVI) and Wetness of Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) derived from 14 scenes of Landsat TM date 1988 to 2001. In general, the phenological of growth stages of wetland paddy can be used to distinguish with other seasonal crops. The research results indicate that multi spectral satellite data has a great potential for identi-fication and monitoring cropping pattern in paddy field. Specific character of NDVI and Wetness can also produce a map of cropping pattern in paddy field that is useful to monitor agricultural land condition. The cropping pattern can also be used to estimate irrigation water needed of paddy field in the area. Expected implication of the information obtained from this analysis is useful for guiding more appropriate planning and better agricultural management.",
        "One of new biotic constraints in corn production in Indonesia is leaf blight disease caused by Pantoea sp. which is needed to be controlled. The purpose of this research is to study the potential of Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. as biological control agents against corn leaf blight caused by Pantoea sp. The results showed that all bacterial strains of Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. have potential in inhibiting the growth of Pantoea sp. by showing the clear zone on the agar plate. The antibiosis types are bactercide or bacteriostatic. On pot experiment all bacterial strains showed the reduction of the disease incidence at the same level compared with that of bactericide streptomycin suphate.

        "This study was conducted to find environmentally friendly control methods and to investigate occurrence pattern of grapevine leaf spot, major disease in ‘Campbell early’ cultivar. Grapevine leaf spot caused by Pseudocercospora vitis is one of the most important disease in Korea. The occurrence pattern of leaf spot for ‘Campbell early’ cultivar was conducted in organic vineyards and conventional vineyards of Sangju, the main growing region of grape from 2012 to 2013. As results, the symptom of leaf spot was observed at last-June firstly in the organic vineyards and then the occurrence rate was gradually increased. The rate of lesion area was rapidly increased to 80.2% in last-August. To control grapevine leaf spot, some materials were tested and bicarbonate was selected. The optimum concentration of bicarbonates for control of grapevine leaf spot is 0.5%, and occurrence of grapevine leaf spot by treatment of 0.5% sodium bicarbonate and ammonium bicarbonate were 6.2 or 8.2%, respectively. This result showed that bicarbonate was more effective than Lime Bordeaux mixture in control of grapevine leaf spot widely used in grape organic cultivation for disease control. But phytotoxicity was observed in the treatment of 1% sodium bicarbonate and 2% potassium bicarbonate. So, it is expected that grapevine leaf spot will be successfully controlled by application of 0.5% bicarbonate. ",
        "Mungbean (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek) is a socio-economically important legume crop of Asia. Varieties with large seed size and early maturity are preferred in commercial production. This study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling seed weight and days to flowering in mungbean. The mapping population comprises 155 F2-derived lines from a cross between Kamphaeng Saen 1 (large-seeded and early flowering) and V4718 (small-seeded and late flowering). The F2 population was analyzed with 67 simple sequence repeat markers. The F2:3 families were evaluated for 100-seed weigh and days to flowering in two years, 2008 (one season) and 2011 (two seasons). Composite interval mapping identified six QTLs for 100-seed weight and 5 QTLs for days to flowering. Three genomic regions harbored QTLs for both seed weight and days to flowering, revealing association between the two traits. Comparison of QTLs for both traits found in this study with those reported in azuki bean [Vigna angularis (Willd.) Ohwi & Ohashi] and rice bean [Vigna umbellata (Thunb.)

        "Physical characteristicsare among soil propertiesaffecting the susceptibility to erosion.  Determination of physical characteristics of Ultisol was aimed to evaluate the dynamics of soil properties as well asthe impact on soil erosion and runoff (RO) during soybean cultivation in wet tropical area.  Soybean was planted within erosion plots (18 m2)  at 25% slope in UltisolLimauManis (having > 5000 mm annual rainfall).   Soil samples for physical properties (soil texture, bulk density, total pore, permeability, aggregate stability,and organic carbon) as well as amount of RO and soil loss were analyzed at 5 different times (stages) during the cultivation.  The results showed that there was fluctuation in physical properties of Ultisol during the cultivation. Likewise, the amount of runoff and soil loss also changed during the study.  Among the physical properties analyzed, the aggregate stability index of the soil highly correlated to the amount of RO (R2=0.73) and soil loss (R2=0.94).  Amount of RO and soil loss was controlled by soybean development at the average rainfall intensity ≤ 36 mm/day, but not at rainfall intensity >36 mm/day.  It is suggested not to open heavily clayey-low OC soils for seasonal crop farming during rainy season in wet tropical area.",

        "The apple blossom weevil (Anthonomus pomorum L.) is dispersed in almost every European country in the pome fruit growing regions; in Romania it can be observed between the Quercus forest steppe region and the steppe region, the economic impact being very important due to the damage produced by the pest which can achieve very high rates of losses. Forecasting\r\nthe main biological development stages of the pest is a key element in the control of this pest.The main research objectives of the experiment were: the study of the biology of colonization\r\ndynamics of the pest according to the biological development stages; the comparing of the efficiency of two monitoring techniques: classical limb jarring method and newly designed bubble wrap method; the study of the main meteorological factors which had an impact of the apple blossom weevil biology. Capture results by the two monitoring techniques show close values, the\r\nseasonal culmination of the apple blossom weevil colonization occurred at the end of March (27.03.2015) with more than 50 adults/tree. Observations were effectuated according to the\r\nphenological stages of apple bud development (BBCH method); feeding of both female and male adults occurred between silvery green tip (BBCH 52) and pink bud stage (BBCH 57), thus\r\ncrawling, feeding, mating, oviposition occurred on the days with temperatures above 6 ˚C. For every holometabolic development stage it was calculated the sum of temperatures at the\r\nbeginning and at the end of the biological phase. For the newly designed bubble wrap method there where used two kind of bubble wrap types, results showed that the bubble wrap with larger spaces within the bubble wrap is more suitable for the weevil capture than smaller ones. With the use of the transparent bubble wrap method it was possible not only the reutilization of the wrap by tightening back on the trunk of trees but also the easy numbering of weevils without the risk of damaging the buds and the branches. The gathered data indicated that the main environmental factors expressed by the mean, minimum, maximum temperatures, relative humidity and rainfall influenced directly the completing of the biological developmental stages of the apple blossom weevil (Anthonomus pomorum L.).

        "Soil moisture content (SMC), in addition to soil water potential, is an important soil index in irrigation application. However, SMC is difficult to determine in field and its estimation can be done by various methods. The objective of this paper is to estimate volumetric soil moisture status by using crop water stress index (CWSI) in a peach orchard for irrigation scheduling. Tree canopy temperature (Tc) was measured by using thermal images in a peach orchard for irrigation scheduling. Tc was investigated in three irrigation regime treatments (factor A) that produced various SMC values, three cardinal points (factor B): South, North and East-West aspects combined, and five up-down vertical position measurements (factor C: upper, middle upper, middle, middle lower and lower) across the tree canopy thermal images. The standard errors of the estimate (SEE) between measured and estimated SMC values range from 1.7 to about 2.2 % of volume. These values essentially show the approximate size of SMC. However, this method can be promising if it is improved by reducing differences between the conditions of determining CWSI and farming conditions. Consequently, the method could be used in orchard region or countries with similar soil and climate conditions.",

        "Riptortus linearis represents the most common pod sucking pest on soybean. Genetic studies on inheritance of resistance to the pest are needed. The study used B4400 and B3802 genotypes as resistant parents, Tambora as susceptible parent. Crosses were made to form F2 population of Tambora x B4400, and Tambora x B3802. A total of 10-20 seeds each of resistant and susceptible parents, 220 F2 seeds of Tambora x B4400 crosses, and 232 F2 seeds of Tambora x B3802 crosses were grown in pots, one plant/pot. The plants were infested with adult R. linearis (riptortus), at the R2 stage. The results showed that the population of riptortus in each of the F2 soybean population at 7 and 15 days after infestation were >2 insects/25 plants, which enables the study of genetic resistance to soybean pod sucker. Heritability values indicated that resistance to pod sucker was controlled by genetic factors. The resistance to riptortus in B4400 and B3802 genotypes was controlled by two recessive genes located at different loci, and interacted with each other with epistatic dominant reaction. With an assumption that B and C genes were dominant, hence the resistance genes found in both soybean genotypes were bbcc.",

        "The hybrid rice program has been established since early 1990’s at the Indonesia Center for Rice Research (ICRR). Twenty-four experimental hybrid rice varieties which have been developed were tested in lowland rice fields in Sukamandi (West Java) and Batang (Central Java) during the dry season and the rainy season of 2012. Randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications was used in each location. The results showed that grains yields were affected by locations, seasons, and genotypes. The genotypes x locations x seasons interaction effect was significant; therefore, the best hybrid was different for each location and season. A7/PK36 hybrid has the best performance in Batang during the dry season, while A7/PK40 and A7/PK32 are the best hybrids in the rainy season. In Sukamandi, nine hybrids were identified as better yielder than that of the check cultivar in the dry season, but not so in the rainy season. Using the correlation and path analysis, we found that the number of panicles per hill and the number of filled grains per panicle could be used as selection criteria for yield in hybrid rice.",

There were 4 experiments in series, consisting of N, P, K various level and N,K alone and combination on the growth and  quantity  of rhizome arranged in  randomized block design comprising 7 levels of fertilizer per plant with 3 replications. The treatments of urea (N), SP36 (P) consisted of 0, 1,25, 2,5, 3,75, 5, 6,25 and 7.5 g. The KCl (K) comprised 0, 1,5, 3, 4,5, 6, 7,5 and 9 g. The N, K alone and combination treatments consisted of (No fertilizer, N, K, NK g /plant). The results of this research were N, P, K optimum dose of each N 6.25 g N / plant P2O5/tan P 6.25 g, K 7.5 g K2O / plant increased temulawak rhizome dry weight. Combination 4.5 g N + 2.8 g K / plant could increase temulawak rhizome dry weight by 33% compared to the addition of N and 220% when compared to the addition of a single K harvesting age 6 months.",
        "This study aimed to classify the types of sweet potato based on the ratio of total dry matter of roots to vine (R/V) in order to make the option available in integrating the crop-livestock systems. Seventeen sweet potato cultivars were planted in Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications applied at two locations, Malang and Blitar. Each cultivar planted in plot measures 2.5 m x 5 m in Malang and 3.0 m x 5 m in Blitar, and each consists of four rows with a spacing of 25 cm in rows. All cultivars gave a dose of 250 kg NPK fertilizer (15-15-15)/ha twice, one-third of dose given at planting and the remainder in a month after planting. Plants were harvested at four months after planting. Fresh weight and dry weight of storage root, fresh weight and dry weight of vines, harvest index, and the ratio R/V are determined.  There was different performance of 17 cultivars planted at two locations. Cultivars planted in Malang were classified into four types, namely forage, which consists of three cultivars among 17 cultivars, low dual-purpose (3 cultivars), high dual-purpose (7 cultivars), and low root production (4 cultivars); while cultivars planted in Blitar turned into the forage type.",
        "Fattened bulls are the main source of beef in the Czech Republic (CR) and in most other EU countries. Profitability of fattening operations is a fundamental prerequisite for increasing domestic beef production. The objective of this study was to assess the economic efficiency of bull fattening operations in CR during 2013 and 2014. Data from 17 operations were collected using a questionnaire. Major cost items were determined and the return on costs was calculated while either including or excluding support payments. In 2013, average total costs reached 24,038 CZK per bull and a 1,152 CZK loss was incurred. In 2014, total costs were similar as in 2013 but the loss was 3,238 CZK per bull as a result of a higher initial purchase price of bulls at the beginning of the fattening period. Break‑even points, defined as those points at which the operation reaches zero profitability, were estimated for daily live weight gains (1,189 and 1,290 g/day in 2013 and 2014, respectively) and for selling prices of bulls (91.19 and 96.05 CZK/kg of carcass in 2013 and 2014, respectively). A sensitivity analysis revealed that the most influential parameters were purchase and selling prices and live weight gains of bulls.",
        "Aim of this study was an analysis and assessment of the economy and energy effectiveness of winter wheat and winter rape cultivation for liquid biofuel production. The cost of production and economical effect index is more profitable in case of winter rape. Also the final balance of energy effectiveness has shown better values if the biodiesel had been produced from winter rape as compared with bioethanol from winter wheat. Calculation of the obtained products and their comparison with an energy unit has shown that the netto energy from biodiesel was positive while that from bioethanol was negative, which means that in the latter case expenditure is greater than that gained in the produced biofuel.",
        "Legal system forces every economic agent operating on the market to fulfil some amount of duties and it alternates their decision making. This regulation moves the equilibria of each individual subject including firms, which have to adjust their production plans in a way prescribed by the law. We develop a theoretical background of production under the legal regulation and compare alternate equilibria with different degrees of legal regulation, which is described as unproductive in economic literature. The model shows that regulated production plans and all used inputs are still productive but the level of satisfaction within the society is decreased.",
        "The Erhualian (EHL) pig possesses significantly lower growth rates and\nhigher adipose deposition compared with the Large White (LW) pig. To further\nunderstand the mechanism of breed lipid deposition difference at the early\npostnatal age, we employed an animal model of EHL and LW pigs at weaning age to\ncompare the lipid metabolism differences in subcutaneous fat. The result\nshowed that serum triglyceride in EHL was significantly higher\n(<i>P</i> < 0.05) than that of LW. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ\nprotein level in EHL was significantly higher (<i>P</i> < 0.01) though CCTTA\nenhancer-binding protein level demonstrated no change compared with LW pigs.\nHormone sensitive lipase, adipose tissue triglyceride lipase mRNA expression\nand the lipase activity were significantly lower (<i>P</i> < 0.05) in EHL.\nUncoupling protein-2 protein content was significantly lower (<i>P</i> < 0.01) in EHL than that in LW pigs. We first cloned the nucleotide sequence\nof Zinc-α2-glycoprotein (ZAG) with 1090 bp and found that both ZAG\nmRNA expression and protein level in EHL pigs was significantly lower\n(<i>P</i> < 0.01) than that of LW pigs. β3 adrenergic receptor mRNA\nexpression in EHL pigs was significantly higher (<i>P</i> < 0.01) than that of LW\npigs, though tumour necrosis factor α gene expression demonstrated\nno significant difference. Therefore, the significant breed lipid metabolism\ndifference in subcutaneous fat exists at an early postnatal age\nbetween EHL and LW pigs, and this difference may originate from two causes\nincluding the increased lipid synthesis and reduced lipid mobilization in\nEHL pigs compared with LW pigs.",
        "Drought is one of the major causes of reduction of crop yields worldwide, a problem that will increase in the next decades due to climate change. We describe here an initial attempt to define biochemical markers associated to water stress in several hazelnut cultivars, by measuring the levels of common osmolytes and the generation of secondary oxidative stress, in plants subjected to water stress, and after recovery from the stress treatment. Proline appears to be a reliable marker in this species, as its accumulation in leaves correlates well with the degree of stress affecting the plants. Differences between cultivars in relative Pro accumulation and oxidative stress suggested that some cultivars are more tolerant than others and could be selected for cultivation in drought-affected areas",
        "Pistachio is considered as an important agricultural commodity in Iran and ranks top amongst all exported agricultural products. Conducting an overall energy audit and economic analysis of pistachio production can provide useful information to help implement management strategies for improving energy efficiency. A study was conducted during 2009 and 2010 to evaluate the overall energy inputs and outputs and to perform an economic analysis of pistachio production in the Iranian province of Markazi. The results revealed that the total energy input for pistachio production was 54305 MJ ha-1. Electricity, followed by diesel fuel and nitrogen fertilizer application were the highest contributors to energy input in pistachio orchards. The contribution of direct energy was higher than indirect energy and share of non-renewable energy was more than renewable energy. Net energy, energy use efficiency, energy productivity and specific energy were 7522 MJ ha-1, 0.86, 0.08 kg MJ-1 and 13.69 MJ kg-1, respectively. Econometric model based on Cobb-Douglas function indicated that impacts of electricity, diesel fuel and chemical fertilizer energy inputs on pistachio yield were positive while the impact of machinery was negative. The marginal physical productivity (MPP) value for diesel fuel was the highest among other variables, followed by energy inputs related to the chemicals and irrigation water. The results revealed that production of pistachios in Markazi Province, under current management practices, are not energy efficient and efforts should be made to improve energy use efficiency.",
        "The paper deals with problems concerning customers’ satisfaction. It summarizes results of primary research focused on an analysis of fundamental factors, which shape clients’ preferences, influence the level of satisfaction of transportation companies´ customers in general and in transportation companies under study in particular. Altogether 49 % of respondents mentioned that the type of transportation means was the most important factor that influenced their satisfaction. As other significant factors influencing the satisfaction of respondents the following were mentioned: prices of transportation, quality of services during the transportation, respecting regular pauses during transportation, and the possibility of refreshments during the transportation. All companies that were addressed monitored the level of satisfaction of their customers (nearly 20 % did this every month). Each company that monitored satisfaction of its customers every year also developed a marketing plan of their activities. The paper also contains detailed results of conducted inquiries as well as the relevant discussion.",
        "Catch crops mainly reduce soil erosion and leaching of nutrients as well as enrich the soil organic matter. The aim of this research is to evaluate the yields of catch crops of Sinapis alba, Phacelia tanacetifolia, Fagopyrum esculentum, Carthamus tinctorius and Secale cereale v. multicaule, and thus determine the possible applicability of catch crops in areas with high average annual temperature and low precipitation totals. The small-plot field experiment was performed on clay-loam gleyic fluvisol at the Field Experimental Station in Žabčice, Southern Moravia, Czech Republic, within the period of 2006-2014. The catch crops were set up after winter wheat in mid-August. The results have shown a statistically significant difference among different catch crops in yield of dry matter and even among years. The yield of catch crops is mainly dependent on a sufficient supply of water in the soil and the appropriate amount and distribution of rainfall over the growing season. Sinapis alba and Phacelia tanacetifolia regularly reached the highest yields. High yields were also achieved with Fagopyrum esculentum. Due to the method of crop rotation in the Czech Republic, with a predominance of Brassica napus var. napus, it is inappropriate to include Sinapis alba. It is the best to grow Phacelia tanacetifolia and even Fagopyrum esculentum, or a mixture thereof, depending on the use of catch crops.",
        "Introduction\nThe quality of primary medical care for children in Poland is unsatisfactory. In the ranking known as ‘the European Health Consumer Index’, Poland (taking the patient point of view on healthcare quality) is classified on the 27th position out of the 33 possible. The unsolved problems concern inter alia the quality and availability of night paediatric urgent care.\n\nObjective\nThe aim was assessing the quality as well as the level of satisfaction with the night paediatric urgent care in the Lublin Province of eastern Poland.\n\nMaterial and Methods\nThe materials for this study consisted of 540 parents of children aged 6–16 years benefiting from night paediatric urgent medical assistance in Lublin Province. The survey was conducted using the Original Survey Questionnaire.\n\nResults\nInhabitants of the Lublin Province (regardless of place of residence) generally assessed the quality and accessibility of night paediatric urgent care facilities as only satisfactory. Inhabitants living in rural areas have worse access to night paediatric urgent care facilities because of having to travel greater distances, and receive less comprehensive medical assistance than inhabitants living in more urbanized areas, and they are more often referred to hospital emergency departments. During the past five years, both the availability and quality of night paediatric urgent care did not change significantly.\n\nConclusions\nInhabitants of the Lublin Province (regardless of place of residence) generally assessed the quality as well as accessibility of night paediatric urgent care facilities as only satisfactory. Rural residents have more reasons for dissatisfaction than urban dwellers. Both the quality and availability of such medical care needs to be improved.",
        "Precise determination of potato tubers’ shape and variability existing among individual potato varieties is necessary e.g. for modeling of handling and transport processes. The procedures described in the work are used for determination and evaluation of potato tubers shape variability and proportional importance of four main principal components. Ten different potato varieties were analyzed (Karin, Karlena, Krasa, Marilyn, Princess, Red Anna, Rosara, Sazava, Vendula, and Vera) and elliptic Fourier descriptors employed for description of tubers shape. Following principal components were quantified: height to width ratio, position of the center of gravity, curvature, and degree of roundness. The scores of the resulting components were used in subsequent analysis as tuber shape characteristic. The first four principal components covered almost 100 % of the total variance in both, front and side-view shape and 97 % in top-view shape. Height to width ratio was evaluated as the determining parameter with contribution of 70.58–74.02 % of the total shape variation (front-view) for Karin and Vendula varieties respectively. The other principal components were significantly less affecting the overall variability. It was confirmed that described approach is precise and usable procedure for potato tubers shape analysis.",
        "In this paper the effect of the Origanum aetheroleum - essential oil on the production growth and health of broiler chickens in conditions of welfare was studied. The animals had a free access to feedstuff and water. The experiment was carried out in 2 cycles on broiler types Ross 308 and Cobb 500. The viability, welfare and the body weight of broiler chickens at the end of each cycle was detected. The breeding was kept in the terms of welfare. The viability in trial groups (fed with feedstuff enriched with Origanum aetheroleum - essential oil was 100% while in the control groups the viability was 98% in first cycle carried out on Ross 308 and 98% in the second cycle carried out on Cobb 500. The average body weight of chickens at the end of the first cycle in control group was 1376.80 g while the average body weight of chickens at the end of the first cycle in trial group was 1767.2 g. The differences between these two groups were highly significant (P0.05). The average body weight of chickens at the end of the second cycle in control group was 1589.6 g while the average body weight of chickens at the end of the second cycle in trial group was 1567.2 g. The difference between these two groups was not significant (P0.05).",
        "The growing interest in the development of chains for the use of agroforestry biomass for energy demand, is due to the awareness they are a crucial element to mitigate the global climatic change effects. The true effort is to have a reliable estimation of biomass availability by some instruments like forest management plans, which allow to locate the forest supply and to know the forest biomass availability in a medium period. In this paper we carried out a decision analysis by geographic information system, in Tuscia Romana area comprising 11 municipalities for a total amount of 813 km2. An estimation was carried out taking into account the bibliographic data on the analyzed species, reporting the biomass in weight taken out by the forest cut utilization. A comparison was also performed in field on chestnut trees cut in a sampling area near Bracciano and in a close sawmill. The results show long, medium and short-term dynamics, but some critical points were found related to the process of estimation and to the real procurement of biomass in some years. The results suggest to be care in a possible project of a biomass plant.",
        "Intramammary infection and clinical mastitis in dairy cows leads to\r\nconsiderable economic losses for farmers. The somatic cell\r\nconcentration in cow's milk has been shown to be an excellent\r\nindicator for the prevalence of subclinical mastitis. In this study,\r\na new somatic cell count index (SCCI) was proposed for the accurate\r\nprediction of milk yield losses caused by elevated somatic cell\r\ncount (SCC). In all, 97 238 lactations (55 207 Holstein cows) from\r\n2328 herds were recorded between 2010 and 2014 under different\r\nscenarios (high and low levels of SCC, four lactation stages,\r\ndifferent milk yield intensities, and parities (1, 2, and  ≥  3).\r\nThe standard shape of the curve for SCC was determined using\r\ncompleted standard lactations of healthy cows. The SCCI was defined\r\nas the sum of the differences between the measured interpolated\r\nvalues of the natural logarithm of SCC (ln(SCC)) and the values for the standard shape of the curve for SCC for a particular period, divided by the total area enclosed by the standard curve and upper limit of ln(SCC)  =  10 for SCC. The phenotypic potential of milk yield (305-day milk yield &ndash; MY305) was calculated using regression coefficients estimated from\r\nthe linear regression model for parity and breeding values of cows\r\nfor milk yield. The extent of daily milk yield loss caused by\r\nincreased SCC was found to be mainly related to the early stage of\r\nlactation. Depending on the possible scenarios, the estimated milk\r\nyield loss from MY305 for primiparous cows was at least 0.8 to\r\n0.9 kg day<sup>−1</sup> and for multiparous cows it ranged from 1.3 to\r\n4.3 kg day<sup>−1</sup>. Thus, the SCCI was a suitable indicator for\r\nestimating daily milk yield losses associated with increased SCC and\r\nmight provide farmers reliable information to take appropriate\r\nmeasures for ensuring good health of cows and reducing milk yield\r\nlosses at the herd level.",
        "The global meat market and primarily the chicken meat market represents a very dynamically developing area. The objective of the present article is the analysis of the chicken meat market in the world in order to identify the basic development trends associated with the development of production of and trade in chicken meat, and also in order to identify the individual entities controlling the global chicken meat market. In methodological terms, the article analyzes the development of production of, consumption of and trade (export and import) in chicken meat in the years 1961–2009. The main sources of data necessary for the processing of the individual analyses are the FAOSTAT and UN COMTRADE databases. The results of the conducted analysis show the following findings. World production of poultry meat increased from 7.5 million tons to more than 86 million tons. The global market reacted in a flexible manner, in which there was an increase in volumes of executed trade from 271 thousand tons/year in the year 1961 to more than 10.7 million tons/year in the year 2010. Further, the value of world trade in chicken meat within the analyzed period increased from approximately USD 169 million to approximately USD 16 billion. If we analyze the global chicken meat market, it may be stated that it is very concentrated. The analysis of the global market further shows that Brazil, the USA and China represent, in terms of global production, consumption and trade, the main driving force on the chicken meat market. These three countries have a share in global production of approximately 46%, their share in global consumption ranges at a level of over 40%. The share of these countries in global export ranges at a level exceeding 50%.",
        "In this experiment on three dairy cows with the ruminal and duodenal T-cannulas, the actual and predicted amino acid (AA) profiles of the protein fraction flowed to the small intestine were compared. The prediction was calculated by two methods: with the use of mean published AA profile of microbial protein and of experimentally determined one. The actual AA profile of digesta protein was corrected for glycine (Gly) of bile origin. In comparison to the published AA profile of microbial protein the use of the actual one did not contribute to an improvement of prediction accuracy (mean prediction error: 7.36 vs. 7.54 %, respectively). Inaccurate determination of AA composition of undegraded feed protein and the insufficient correction for Gly of bile origin were the probable sources of the residual variability. ",
        "Traditionally reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) has been cultivated for forage, but currently is a new non-food crop in northern Europe. The aim of this study was to evaluate reed canary grass germplasm, elite and wild populations, for non-food, forage and seed production. An index composed of different agronomic traits was used to establish the best populations for each end-use. Populations were also ranked according to biomass or seed yield only. Non-food cultivars have not yet been developed, but results from this study suggest that some high biomass forage cultivars could be used in non-food production. However, local populations possessed a desirable combination of traits, including higher proportion of straw associated with high biomass yield. This study indicated that local populations could be used in non-food crop breeding together with elite material. Some evidence for the potential of populations for forage production was also noted, mainly through leaf area and leaf proportion measurements. High non-food or forage indices were associated with good seed production in some populations. Results help in selecting appropriate cultivars for non-food use, which is currently important as the cultivated area of reed canary grass for biofuel in Finland is anticipated to be 75 000 hectares by 2010.;",
        "Rural tourism has come to occupy a prominent position in the debate about rural restructuring in all OECD countries, partly because of demand changes which favour rural tourism and partly because rural agencies recognise a need to provide economic activities with potential for growth in a rural economy in which traditional providers of rural employment (such as agriculture) have been shedding labour at a rapid rate. Well-designed strategy is essential to its success in impacting on the rural economy. The structures for collaboration and co-operation must be developed and combined with a process of education and training. Co-operative effort must be effective and sustainable. The tourism related businesses should not be isolated from the larger community and its issues.The principal motivation for a community, business or region to serve tourists is generally economic. An individual business is interested primarily in its own revenues and costs, while a community or region is concerned with tourism’s overall contribution to the economy, as well as social, fiscal and environmental impacts. A good understanding of tourism’s economic impacts is therefore important for the tourism industry, government officials, and the community as a whole.The principal objective of the study, that is reported here, was to determine the potential income of farmers from the provision of agro-tourism services. First, the paper reviews selected results of the visitor spending survey in alternative types of rural tourism of the region Southeast (Czech Republic); second the direct economic benefit of the agro-tourism in this region is estimated, and finally, critical factors reducing the effectiveness of agro-tourism as a rural development instrument are drawn.",
        "The goal of the paper was to identify  - lactoglobulin gene polymorphism in bulls. The  - lactoglobulin (LGB) is expressed in milk and is important in the evaluation of milk production potential and butterfat and protein content. LGB is localized on bovine chromosome 11. The AA genotype of LGB is associated with higher milk yield, the BB genotype with higher fat and casein content and is more desirable for cheese making. The material involved 46 bulls (Slovak spotted breed – 41 bulls, Pinzgau breed – 3 bulls and Holstein breed – 2 bulls). Bovine genomic DNA was isolated from sperm using commercial kit NucleoSpin Tissue and used in order to estimate LGB genotypes by means of PCR RFLP method and high resolution melting analysis (HRMA). In the population of Slovak spotted breed we detected all genotypes AA, AB and BB with frequency 0.3415, 0.4390 and 0.2195, subsequently. In Pinzgau breed was detected homozygote genotypes AA and BB with frequency 0.3333 and 0.6667. In Holstein breed was observed only heterozygote genotype AB with frequency 1.",

        "The current designs of thermal insulation for buildings concentrate on the achievement of the required heat transmission coefficient. However, another factor that cannot be neglected is the assessment of the possible water vapour condensation inside the construction. The aim of the study was to find out whether the designed modification of the cladding structure of an existing log house will or will not lead to a risk of possible water vapour condensation in the walls after an additional thermal insulation mounting. The condensation could result in the increase in moisture of the walls and consequently the constructional timber, which would lead to the reduction of the timber construction strength, wood degradation by biotic factors – wood-destroying insects, mildew or wood-destroying fungi. The main task was to compare the theoretically established values of moisture of the constructional timber with the values measured inside the construction using a specific example of a thermal insulated log house. Three versions of thermal insulation were explored to find the solution of a log house reconstruction which would be the optimum for living purposes. Two versions deal with the cladding structure with the insulation from the interior, the third version deals with an external insulation.In a calculation model the results can be affected to a great degree by input values (boundary conditions). This especially concerns the factor of vapour barrier diffusion resistance, which is entered in accordance with the producer’s specifications; however, its real value can be lower as it depends on the perfectness and correctness of the technological procedure. That is why the study also includes thermal technical calculations of all designed insulation versions in the most unfavourable situation, which includes the degradation of the vapour barrier down to 10% efficiency, i.e. the reduction of the diffusion resistance factor to 10% of the original value. Moreover, the dependence of the weight moisture of timber inside the insulated cladding on temperature-moisture changes in the internal and external ambient environment was examined.",
        "In Italy the standard wintertime protecting solution used for brown garden snail(Helix aspersa aspersa) inside open air rearing technology is to cut the plants to 20cm and to protect the rearing pen with agryl-sheet, named in italian language Tessuto-NonTessuto or for short TNT. But this method isn`t suited for our country colderwinters. Low temperatures registered during 2005 - 2006 winter and hibernationbehaviour inadequate understanding led to high mortality rates, estimated to over85%, in most of the outdoor snail farms all around Romania.In order to solve the problem we studied some aspects of brown garden snail ecologicplasticity, his hibernation behavior inside outdoor snail farms and researched thepossibilities of implementing some alternative wintertime protective methods. As aresult we developed the “sandwich” system based on straw non-conducting propertiesconceived in such a manner to provide an efficient adiabatic protection while theinside aeration is enough to limit as much as possible the straw mass moistening.",
        "A smart grid is defined where different elements are interconnected between them and with the public utility grid. The development of smart grids is considered a strategic goal at both national and international levels and has been funded by many research programs. Within the BEE (Building Energy Ecosystems) project, funded by the Piedmont Region under the European POR FESR 2007-13 scheme, the creation of an electricity smart grid at a local level in a small agroindustry was done. This industry is one of the so-called prosumer, that is both a producer and a consumer of energy. The energy production is done by means of solar photovoltaic and biomass. In this local smart grid, the elements were subdivided in two main groups: loads (process machineries in the case study) and generators (PV and biomass in the case study). The loads may be further subdivided into permanent loads, mandatory loads and shiftable loads. The objective of the smart grid is the minimization of the exchanges between the local grid and the public utility grid. Even though no financial savings occur, this is important for the community grid. The problem is therefore to find the conditions that let the net exported energy going to zero at each time step, so arriving close to a self-sufficient system by modifying the shiftable loads. In a first phase of the study, the consumers were studied and, according to some characteristics of the machineries employed and the production requirements, grouped into production lines that can or not be switched off for intervals of time in order to compensate the smart grid fluctuations. The smart grid balancing may be done on an instantaneous basis, or in a predictive way considering the future weather forecasts and the future production requirements. The demo site was equipped with measurement instrumentation, data acquisition tools and a user interface that may be used to visualize all the quantities that are measured but also to perform the actions suggested by the optimization strategy (start/stop machineries, organization of production, etc).",
        "The study has monitored the effects of transport stress on some biochemical indicators of stress and behavior lambs at time of slaughter. The research was carried out in the cold season, on a number of 120 lambs, transported for 6h- 16h, to be slaughtered. During our research, we followed the changes in bodyweight, behaviours expressed by sheep, and plasma cortisol levels. Bodyweight loss recorded in the slaughterhouse to 24 hours of departure transportation was of 4-5%. The behavioural manifestations of lambs were different from the destination, depending on journey duration. Lambs behaviour was different depending on the journey, the resting and watering were mostly present manifestations. Increased in cortisol levels measured at 3 h after leaving the vehicle was maintained at 9 h after the journey. Increased duration of rest before slaughter can reduce the stress of transport in case of lambs ensures obtaining good quality meat.",
        "The aim of our investigation was to study the hypophysis- thyroid status of a body in patients with alcoholism, the inhabitants of various biogeochemical zones of the Transcarpathia, in the highlands – with expressed iodine deficiency and in the lowlands – with lower degree of iodine insufficiency. The content of thyroxin, triiodothyromine, thyrotropic hormone in blood serum has been defined by radioimmunologic method with the use of standard test- sets. The general iodine in the blood and urine has been studied by cerium-arsenide method. The peculiarities as to the influence of various ecologically iodine supply of the body upon TSH function of the hypophysis, hormone function of the thyroid gland, iodine reserves of the body both in practically healthy people and in alcoholism have been established. Alcoholism has been shown to be accompanied by the increased losses of iodine with urine and the depletion of the iodine reserves of the body, the increase of T3 level in blood serum both in lowlands and highlands of the Transcarpathia, it being characterized by different degrees of iodine deficiency complicating the existing iodine deficiency of the body. These findings may be good reasons for including iodine correction into the treatment of alcoholism.",
        "To meet the major challenge of increasing rice production to feed a growing population under increasing water scarcity, many water-saving regimes have been introduced in irrigated rice, such as an aerobic rice system, non-flooded mulching cultivation, and alternate wetting and drying (AWD). These regimes could substantially enhance water use efficiency (WUE) by reducing irrigation water. However, such enhancements greatly compromise grain yield. Recent work has shown that moderate AWD, in which photosynthesis is not severely inhibited and plants can rehydrate overnight during the soil drying period, or plants are rewatered at a soil water potential of −10 to −15 kPa, or midday leaf potential is approximately −0.60 to −0.80 MPa, or the water table is maintained at 10 to 15 cm below the soil surface, could increase not only WUE but also grain yield. Increases in grain yield WUE under moderate AWD are due mainly to reduced redundant vegetative growth; improved canopy structure and root growth; elevated hormonal levels, in particular increases in abscisic acid levels during soil drying and cytokinin levels during rewatering; and enhanced carbon remobilization from vegetative tissues to grain. Moderate AWD could also improve rice quality, including reductions in grain arsenic accumulation, and reduce methane emissions from paddies. Adoption of moderate AWD with an appropriate nitrogen application rate may exert a synergistic effect on grain yield and result in higher WUE and nitrogen use efficiency. Further research is needed to understand root–soil interaction and evaluate the long-term effects of moderate AWD on sustainable agriculture.",
        "At the present time characterized by globalizing market, increasing competition, accelerating change and the occurrence of many risks it is necessary for businesses, which want to remain competitive, to be able to respond flexibly to the changes in a timely manner and to identify and manage risks. Companies try to diversify business risks, such as the loss of market share in the domestic market, by entering the foreign markets and participating in international trade. Involvement in the internationalization process cannot be understood only as an opportunity to achieve greater profits and a competitive advantage, it is necessary to consider potential risks accompanying this process, because engaging in the internationalization process may bring the companies many different specific risks. It would be useful for companies to identify the factors of failure resulting from internationalization. Identifying the barriers to internationalization, the main risk factors associated with it and designing their possible prevention or elimination could provide SMEs an impetus to enter foreign markets. Although the risk is a frequently discussed issue in the international discussion, only few studies were strictly focused on risk management in the internationalization process. Risk management is a broad discipline that requires a specific knowledge in practice. However, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises are often unable to identify the potential risks of the internationalization process and therefore are not able to manage the risks. This is due to the fact that SMEs usually do not have managers with a deep knowledge of risk management and, moreover, these managers also often lack experience with foreign markets. Unfortunately, the surveys of SMEs conclude that the poorly predicted risks of entering foreign markets are one of the most common causes of failure of SMEs internationalization process.The main objective of this paper is to identify the risks of the internationalization process of Czech small and medium-sized enterprises. To achieve the main aim, it was necessary to make a survey of current situation in Czech small and medium-sized enterprises with focus on the participation in international trade, compared to the situation of these enterprises in recent years. It was also important to define the risk factors faced by Czech small and medium-sized enterprises in connection with the entry and activities on foreign markets and to identify key risk factors SMEs in the internationalization process are exposed to. It was also necessary to find out the obstacles to the internationalization process affecting the decision of Czech SMEs to penetrate foreign markets. And the last but not least task was to suggest some elementary methods that could be used by Czech small and medium-sized enterprises to eliminate risks in their internationalization process.",
        "The present paper contains the evaluation of rural landscape development in model territories by means of landscape structure analysis. Based on the computed values of landscape ecology indexes, development and typical and specific features of analysed territories are interpreted in defined time horizons. The territories differ in the intensity of their use, natural conditions and different social requirements. Two territories have intensive agriculture in different natural conditions, the third model territory is situated in the protective zone of a water resource, and the fourth model territory is a protected area. For all localities, the studied baseline period was that of the Stable Cadastre mapping (1825–1839), followed by the sixties of the 20th century and the present time. The method of processing and evaluation of four model territories is described and a detailed analysis and interpretation of one territory – Hubenov region is presented. Agricultural land formed the landscape matrix in Hubenov territory in the past and at present. There is a significant reduction in the number of plots of the landscape classes and the increase in the average size of agricultural and non-agricultural plots between year 1825 and 2009. Spatial distribution of agricultural land has changed. Area of arable land decreased after the construction of water reservoir Hubenov. The area of permanent grassland, forests and water bodies increased. It was reflected in an increase of ecological stability. In the context of the change of landscape structures decreased the length of ecotone edges of the categories arable land and PGL and categories arable land and forest.",
        "This paper deals with the investigation of the relationship between firm size and firm in the Czech Republic during 2007–2012. The study aims to examine to what extent the confirmation or rejection of Gibrat’s law depends on the indicator of firm size. For measuring firm size we use three indicators: revenues, number of employees and total assets. The study uses data collected from the database Albertina CZ Gold Edition. Final dataset includes the data about more than 35,000 firms. The validity of Gibrat’s law was tested with the help of linear regression model with first-order autoregressive process. Gibrat’s law is rejected for all three indicators of firm size. Hence, the selected indicator of firm size is not proved to be important factor in verification of Gibrat’s law validity. It is also found out that the small firms in profit industries (A-N according to CZ-NACE classification) grow faster than their larger counterparts in the Czech Republic. ",

        "The use of power plant fly ash, by its physical-chemical properties, can significantly change the characteristics of soils polluted with oil (Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons, TPH), in their rehabilitation process, if combined with biodegradable organic materials, wastes such as sewage sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plant. Maintaining vegetation on soils polluted with 80.5 ± 3.9 g·kg-1 D.M. of TPH under perennial regime specific to bird’s foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), demonstrates the tolerance of the plant to the created conditions by the treatment of polluted soil with adequate amounts of fertilizer and fly ash from burning coal in power stations. The addition of 50-500 g fly ash per vegetation pot equipped with crude oil polluted soil mixed with 250 g sewage sludge per pot has reduced the oil content in the soil, in two ways: on the one hand influenced by the state of development of plants and on the other hand by weather conditions (alternation of seasons). The amount of TPH lost during the 16 months of vegetation in soils polluted with 80.5±3.9 g·kg-1 D.M. was 73.3-77.5 g·kg-1 D.M.",
        "In total, 192 Iberian pigs were used to investigate the effects of net energy (NE) concentration of the diet on growth performance and carcass quality of castrated females (CF) and castrated males (CM). From 30 to 112 kg body weight (BW), three diets were formulated with similar digestible amino acid content per kcal of NE but differing in energy concentration (2,045, 2,175 and 2,305 kcal NE kg-1 from 30 to 81 kg BW and 2,175, 2,305 and 2,445 kcal NE kg-1 from 81 to 112 kg BW). From 112 kg to slaughter (148 kg BW), all pigs received a common finisher diet. Each treatment was replicated eight times and the experimental unit was a pen with four pigs. A decrease in NE concentration of the diet increased feed intake (p&lt;0.05) and tended to impaired feed conversion ratio (p&lt;0.10), whereas carcass and meat quality traits were not affected. Castrated males ate more feed and grew faster but had less fat thickness at the gluteus medius muscle than CF (p&lt;0.05). However, no differences in carcass and meat quality traits between genders were detected. We conclude that a reduction in NE content of the grower diets did not affect growth rate and therefore, it not a valuable alternative to avoid excess of BW at slaughter in Iberian pigs reared under intensive management conditions. Also, both genders can be used for the production of high quality carcasses destined to the dry-cured industry.",

        "Stochastic production frontier analysis is applied in decomposing output growth of grass silage production to technical change, technical efficiency change, scale effect and input growth. For 19902000 in a complete panel of 138 Finnish farms, almost three fourths of the output growth was linked to input growth. The annual technical change, the shift of the production frontier, was on average 1.4 percent. Technical effi- ciency indicated a slightly decreasing tendency, less than 0.2 percent per year. Harvesting techniques were used as indicators of different technologies. The analysis showed that production frontiers differed between harvesting techniques. The choice of harvesting technique seemed to be related to circumstances on the farm. Thus, overall technical efficiency should not be interpreted as a measure of managerial competence when all the factors are not in the farmers control. Controlling background and production environment related factors yields a considerably lower level of technical inefficiency than the models without the control. It is also shown that in general a more productive harvesting technique may be on average less effi- ciently utilized when compared to its own frontier.;",
        "<p>Resumen. En un suelo Humic dystrudepts sembrado con maíz y ubicado en Palmira (Colombia), se estimaron cambios en poblaciones de mesofauna (con énfasis en ácaros y colémbolos) y en algunas de sus propiedades físicas ocasionados por el uso de abonos verdes (AV). Se establecieron cinco tratamientos bajo un diseño experimental de bloques completos al azar: Testigo, Fertilización química, AV, Compost, y AV más Compost. El AV<br />fue una mezcla de Canavalia ensiformis L. y Axonopus scoparius Hitchc. La mesofauna se extrajo con un cilindro metálico de 10 cm de diámetro y 5 cm de altura.

In a Humic Dystrudepts soil located in Palmira (Colombia), changes in populations of mesofauna (with emphasis on mites and collembola) and some of their physical properties due to the use of green manures (GM) were evaluated. Five treatments were established in a randomized complete block design: control, chemical fertilization, GM (green manure), Compost and GM plus Compost. The GM was a mixture of Canavalia ensiformis L. and Axonopus scoparius, Hitchc. Mesofauna was extracted using a metal cylinder of a diameter of 10 cm and 5 cm height. The mesoinvertebrates were separated by the Berlesse-Tullgren method and estimated its richness in taxonomic units (TU) and abundance in number of individuals/785.4 cm3 soil, separating the first 10 cm depth. Sampling was carried out during four periods: before the establishment of the GM, GM growing stage, eight weeks after the addition of the GM and at corn harvest period. Statistical analysis showed that most significant differences occurred among sampling periods and to a lesser extent among treatments. Mites and Collembola constituted the dominant populations in the soil mesofauna. Cutting and adding compost and GM increased populations, being Oribatida and Mesostigmata mites and collembola Entomobryidae and Isotomidae the most abundant. The bulk density, aggregate stability, mites and collembola were sensitive to changes in the corn system using green manure and compost.</p>",
        "The objective of the present study was to explore the effect of the level of inbreeding on milk efficiency of cows and on the content of milk components (fat and protein) in the 1st standard lactation period (305 days). The level of inbreeding (Fx) of inbred cows ranged between 1.25 and 12.5%. Efficiency parame- ters of inbred cows were compared with their contemporaries – half-sisters after the father (n=2567), raised on the same farm whose first lactation ended in same year. Out of the total database (567,036 cows) created in 1980–2002 we incorporated 885 inbred cows. To allow detailed analyses the inbred cows were divided into 3 groups according to the coefficient Fx (1.5–2.3%, 3.0–5.0% and 8.0–12.5%). The database was evaluated using the analysis of variance with 8 fixed effects including the commercial type, own breeding value and breeding value of mother, average efficiency of mother, reproduction parameters (year and age at calving and interval between the 1st and 2nd lactation) and total number of lactations. The statistical programme SAS 8.2 – GLM procedure (Copyright c 1999–2001 by SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for statistical analyses. Compared to their contemporaries the 323 kg reduction of milk production of inbred cows with the lowest value of Fx (1.5–2.3%) was insignificant; the decrease in the relative content of fat and protein was insignificant by 0.01 and 0.02%, respectively. Comparisons between contemporaries and inbred cows with Fx at the level of 3.0–5.0% showed a highly significant 407 kg reduction in milk efficiency. The fat content in milk of inbred cows increased by 0.11% (p&lt;0.01) and the protein content by 0.03% (p&lt;0.05) compared to their contemporaries. The reduction in milk production of inbred cows with the highest level of Fx (8.0–12.5%) was significant, i.e. –572 kg; the fat content increased insignificantly by 0.02%, while the protein content was the same in inbred cows and contemporaries. Comparisons of the milk production of inbred cows at various levels of Fx, taking into consideration the fixed effects, showed that the differences were most marked between groups Fx=1.5–2.3% and Fx=8.0–12.5%; the reduction in milk efficiency was –731 kg. A Fx coefficient higher by 1% reduced the milk efficiency of cows by 90.07 kg, while the fat and protein content increased by 0.001% and 0.002%, respectively. ",
        "Structure of psocid taxocenoses (Psocoptera) were intensively studied in forest ecosystems of the Western Carpathian Mts. and Polonic biogeographical subprovincy during 1997–2001 in the Czech Republic. Vegetation tiers (= altitudinal vegetation zones) were used as a study frame. Only a part of material, i.e. individuals that was found in the forest ecosystems of Querci-fageta s. lat. communities (= the 3rd oak-beech vegetation tier) was evaluated for purpose of this work. This vegetation tier is widespread in large part of the Opavská pahorkatina hills, in large parts of Podbeskydská pahorktina hills, in the Bílé Karpaty hills and in the foothills of the Vsetínské vrchy hills. 1201 adults comprising 29 species were found in total in the 3rd vegetation tier. As eudominant species, the following ones were found: Peripsocus subfasciatus, Caecilius flavius and Stenopsocus lachlani, as dominant species, the following ones were found: Philotarsus parviceps and Caecilius piceus. In natural geobiocenoses with the level of naturalness of 1 or 2, the following species were found: as eudominant species: Caecilius flavidus, Peripsocus phaeopterus, as dominant species, the following ones were found: Caecilius piceus, Peripsocus subfasciatus, Philotarsus parviceps and Elipsocus moebiusi. Taxocenoses of psocids were evaluated by Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and Divisive Cluster Analysis (DvClA). This material was compared to another material gained from various vegetation tiers in the Western Carpathians Mts. The characteristic species composition of psocids in the 3rd vegetation tier was as follows – Elipsocus moebiusi – E. hyalinus – Philotarsus parviceps – Ectopsocus meridionalis – Caecilius flavidus.",
        "The effects of the restriction of the advised daily feed intake (ADFI) during\n1 or 2 weeks on broiler body weight (BW) and carcass composition were\nstudied. A total of 150 1-day-old male broilers (Ross-308) were randomly\nallotted to a control and four experimental treatments with three replicates per\ntreatment. Broilers were subjected to a feeding restriction equal to 75\nand 50 % of ADFI, either for a 7- or a 14-day period, between the 7th and 14th\nand 7th and 21th day of age, respectively. The BW and carcass composition\nwere determined on day 42. From the findings, neither of the two levels of\nrestriction nor the two time intervals had significant effects (<i>P</i> > 0.05)\non the BW or breast and leg weight and proportion, liver\nand most of the body components. However, the feeding treatments show a tendency\n(<i>P</i> = 0.078) to influence the BW, with birds fed 75 % of ADFI for 14 day\nbeing heavier than the control group. For eviscerated carcass weight, an\neffect (<i>P</i> = 0.002) was observed, with birds fed 75 % of ADFI for 14 day\nhaving heavier carcasses (<i>P</i> < 0.05) than those in control group. The\nabdominal fat, both with regard to weight and proportion, was slightly influenced by\ndietary treatments (<i>P</i> > 0.05). From our results, it can be\nconcluded that the applied feeding restrictions have a neutral or slightly\nbeneficial effect on broiler growth traits and carcass composition.",
        "Measurement of students’ knowledge is an essential part of the educational process. Teachers on universities often use computer-based tests to testing a large number of students in a short time. The question is, what kind of information these tests provide, and if it is possible to classify students on this basis. Praxis shows that the scalar test results in the form of simple numbers cannot be plainly interpreted as the level of knowledge; moreover it is not easy to build such tests, which detect the necessary information. In the first part of the article we present the results of pedagogical experiment focused on the difference between information obtained through the computer-based test and a teacher’s interview with the same students. Possible starting point to improve information from computer-based tests in non-scalar form is a construction of an adaptive test, adapting test items to identify knowledge similar to a conversation with a teacher. As a tool for the design of the adaptive tests we use so called study maps, which are described in the second part of the article.",

The first one was a limestone quarry pit called Lesní lom which is located approximately 1 km away from the northern edge of the city district of Brno-Líšeň. The second locality was a limestone quarry of Malá dohoda which is located in a protected landscape area in the northern part of Moravian Karst. Using formaldehyde pitfall traps, 1682 specimens belonging to 66 species were caught in 2012, out of which 847 specimens (49 species) were from the active quarry of Malá dohoda and 835 specimens (40 species) came from Lesní lom quarry which had already been closed for 15 years at the time of research. The most abundant species included Anchomenus dorsalis, Carabus ullrichii ullrichii, C. cancellatus, and Aptinus bombarda. Relict species collected were Aptinus bombarda, Leistus rufomarginatus, and Carabus irregularis irregularis which is together with C. cancellatus, and Cylindera germanica included in the Red List of the Czech Republic. Xerothermophilic species of Carabid beetles found refuge mainly in the quarry marginal sites. In the case of Malá dohoda quarry, the influence of the surrounding PLA Moravian Karst was evident in the distribution of Carabid beetles.",
        "Citrus agro-industry is globally harshened mainly by Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), the most worldwide destructive tephritid fruit fly species. Citrus agro-industry is one of the pillars of Tunisia economy, and by hence, harshened by this species. Tunisia has established an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programme against citrus pests, including C. capitata, that rely on the structured use of pesticides, on the application several trapping protocols, along with pilot-scale sterile insect technique program and, since 2013, with pilot-scale releases of the braconid parasitoid Diachasmimorpha longicaudata Ashmed (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). Insecticide side-effects on parasitoids and other natural enemies are being requested for a successful implementation of biological control within any IPM programme. However, these data are almost scarce for the braconid species D. longicaudata. To this end, we have determined the side-effects of malathion, methidathion, acetamiprid, azadiractin, abamectin, deltametrin+thiacloprid and spinosad, as the most popular insecticides used in Tunisia either as fresh residues or at several aged time points, on the parasitoid D. longicaudata according the IOBC pesticide harm-classification.

        "<p>The possibilities for increasing the productivity and control of the pea weevil (<em>Bruchus pisorum </em>L.) in field pea (<em>Pisum sativum</em> L.) organic cultivation by the use of following bioproducts NeemAzal T/S and Pyrethrum FS-EC (insecticides), applied individually and in combination with Polyversum (growth regulator and fungicide) and Biofa (foliar fertilizer), as well as to evaluate the stability of the used mixtures were studied. Synthetic products Nurelle D and Flordimex 420 (alone and in combination) were used as a standard. The products were applied once (at budding stage) or twice (at budding and flowering stages). The results showed that forage pea productivity was influenced positively by the application of all organic products. The plants treated with the organic combinations formed an average yield of 3190.2 kg/ha, which was only 4.7% lower than that for the synthetic combination of Flordimex+Nurelle D. The highest yield was produced under application of two mixtures: Biofa+Pyrethrum and Polyversum+Pyrethrum at budding and flowering stages (22.0 and 21.8% above untreated control, respectively). These combinations were also distinguished for their most pronounced protective effect against the attack of the pea weevil and decrease in its numbers of 37.0 and 38.5%, respectively. Pyrethrum was distinguished for a lower degree of damaged seeds and a toxic effect against the pea weevil in comparison with NeemAzal. Technologically the most valuable variant, which united high stability, productivity and protection against pea weevil, was the combination of Biofa+Pyrethrum applied twice. Further investigations are indispensible to expand the range of products (bioinsectides, biofertilizers and growth regulators), which provides good insect control and high productivity in pea organic farming conditions.</p>",
        "The efficiency of a novel strain of lactic acid bacteria inoculant (Lactobacillus plantarum VTT E-78076, E76) on the fermentation quality of wilted silage was studied. Furthermore, the possibility to improve aerobic stability of silages by combining an inoculant and chemical preservatives was investigated. Two experiments were conducted with wilted timothy-meadow fescue herbage (dry matter 429 and 344 g kg-1) using six treatments. In experiment I, E76 (106 cfu g-1 fresh matter (FM)) was applied alone and in combination with sodium benzoate (0.3 g kg-1 grass FM) or low rate of formic acid (0.4 l t-1 FM). In experiment II, E76 and a commercial inoculant were applied alone and in combination with sodium benzoate. Untreated silage and formic acid (4 l t-1 FM) treated silage served as negative and positive controls in both experiments. The effect of sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate in experiment I, on aerobic stability was tested by treating silages prior to aerobic stability measurements. The novel lactic acid bacteria inoculant was equally effective in improving fermentation quality as the commercial inoculant. However, the aerobic stability of both inoculated silages was poorer than that of formic acid treated or the untreated one in one of the experiments. The results suggested that antimicrobial properties of E76 were not effective enough to improve aerobic instability. One option to overcome this problem is to use chemical additives in combination with the inoculants.;",
        "Mechanical pruning, usually integrated with manual finishing, still excites some doubts regarding the quality of the cut which appears not to be the best as precision and cleanliness. This aspect, probably conditioned by the model and the application of pruning machines, might also be affected by the characteristics of the vine branches in particular by their cutting force. In order to evaluate the cutting force on different vine type, laboratory and field trails were carried out. The experiments were set in order to evaluate this parameter during winter pruning in relation to three variables: vine type; branch size; pruning time. The results show how the cutting resistance of vine branches during vegetative rest depends on vine variety (Trebbiano 675 N Cabernet 1175 N), on the diameter of the canes (increase of force from 56 % to 86 % between the classes of diameter) and on the pruning date (26% decrease of the cutting force in the latest period for Trebbiano and Sangiovese, and 32 % for Cabernet Sauvignon). Such variations, which can be considerable, affect directly the pruning results. High values of cutting force can generate tiring of operator in manual pruning or cutting damages on the vegetation during mechanical pruning.",
        "The paper deals with the problems of evaluating of chosen chemical and physical properties of soil in between vineyards that are managed by various mechanization. Measuring was undertaken in viticulture region of South Moravia, at two experimental sites in Mikulov district. Soil surface between rows of vines is managed by regular cultivation (plow, disc cultivator) to a depth of 30–70 mm in the form of a black fallow. On each of vineyards is used a different type of energy resource to carry out working operations – New Holland TN 75 V, a multifunction carrier PELLENC OPTIMUM. While driving in between vine rows, the two machines in completely different tracks, which significantly influences the properties of the soil and its consolidation. The soil samples were analyzed for determining the soil structure, physical and chemical properties, whereby evaluated were also the mechanical properties of the soil profile in the inter-row using Penetrometry. The average structural coefficient in both variants ranged from 0.96 to 2.42. Soil with values ​​lower than 1.0 is below the structural stability, thus reducing the quality of the soil environment in terms of both physical and chemical properties. The resulting values ​​of density of the soil at both sites are between 1.35 to 1.52 g.cm−3, which also shows its unsatisfactory condition. Penetration resistance of soil located in the tire tracks on both sites values ​​from 2.7 to 2.9 MPa, which according to the scale of classes determined by (Arshad, 1996), corresponds with high values. The distribution of soil penetration resistance on soil maps show that in terms of the implementation of mechanized operations, it is preferable to use the portal carrier.",
        "In mammals, the Y chromosome plays a pivotal role in male sex\r\ndetermination and is essential for normal sperm production. A number of\r\nstudies were conducted on Y chromosome genes of various species and\r\nidentified single-copy and multi-copy genes. However, limited studies\r\nabout donkey Y chromosome genes have been done. In this study, 263 male\r\nsamples from 13 Chinese donkey breeds were collected to analyze the copy\r\nnumber variations (CNVs) of five Y chromosome genes using the quantitative PCR\r\n(qPCR) method. These five genes (cullin 4 B Y (<i>CUL4BY</i>),\r\nequus testis-specific transcript y1 (<i>ETSTY1</i>),\r\nequus testis-specific transcript y4 (<i>ETSTY4</i>), equus testis-specific transcript Y 5\r\n(<i>ETSTY5</i>), and sex-determining region Y (<i>SRY</i>) were identified as\r\nmulti-copy, whose median copy numbers (MCNs) were 5, 45, 2, and 2, and\r\n13 with CNV ranges of 1–57, 1–227, 1–37, 1–86 and 1–152, respectively. The\r\nCNVs of these five genes were shared in different breeds. Compared to\r\nprevious studies, the copy numbers of five genes showed some distinct\r\nconsequences in this study. In particular, the well-known single-copy <i>SRY</i> gene\r\nshowed CNVs in donkeys. Our results provided genetic variations of donkey Y\r\nchromosome genes.",
        "Improving growth rates in indigenous Turcana breed should be one of the most important objectives for sheep specialists, do to the fact that over 70% of the sheep population from Romania is represented by the breed. Researches were carried out in a commercial farm from Timis county, on a number of 48 crossbreed F1 German Blackheaded Mutton x Turcana (GBMT) lambs, the control group was represented by purebreed Turcana (TU) lambs, both males and females (33 heads). The lambs were weighed at birth, at 28 days and at 8 months of age. During first 28 days, F1 GMBT registered an average daily gain of 229.46 g, compared to Turcana lambs witch registered an average of 194.12 g, differences being very significant statistically (p<0.001). Total growth gain at the age of 240 days was registered 40.51 kg in crossbreed lambs, and of 33.35 kg in purebreed Turcana lambs, differences were very significant statistically between the two groups (p<0.001). German Blackheaded Mutton rams could be used as crossing sires for indigenous Turcana breed in order to substantially improve growth rates in F1 lambs.",
        "The subject of this paper concerns the state enterprise in the Czech and European Law. In this paper the attention is paid especially to the primary law arrangement, involved in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. These problems are tightly connected with the area of the Competition Law in the EU single market. There is very important the comparison of public enterprises and the state monopolies in the European Law with the legal arrangement of the state enterprises in the legal order of the Czech Republic. The focus is then on finding similarities or differences in both legal regulations that might cause problems. The point is to suggest a regulation enabling to overcome possible discrepancies. At the end we summarize the results drawing respective conclusions and formulating subjects for discussion.",
        "Two experiments were conducted to verify whether the time of day at which a milk sample is collected and the possible carryover in the milking system may affect pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAG) levels and, consequently, the pregnancy test results in dairy cows. In experiment one, we evaluated the effect of time of day at which the milk sample is collected from 51 cows. In experiment two, which evaluated the possible occurrence of carryover in the milk meter milking system, milk samples from 94 cows belonging to two different farms were used. The samples were subjected to pregnancy test using ELISA methodology to measure PAG concentrations and to classify the samples as positive (pregnant), negative (nonpregnant), or suspicious (recheck). We found that the time of milking did not affect the PAG levels. As to the occurrence of carryover in the milk meter, the PAG levels of the samples collected from Farm-2 were heavily influenced by a carryover effect compared with the samples from Farm-1. Thus, milk samples submitted to a pregnancy test can be collected during the morning or the evening milking. When the sample is collected from the milk meters, periodic equipment maintenance should be noted, including whether the milk meter is totally drained between different animals’ milking and equipment cleaning between milking is performed correctly to minimize the occurrence of carryover, thereby avoiding the effect on PAG levels and, consequently, the pregnancy test results. Therefore, a single milk sample can be used for both milk quality tests and pregnancy test.",
        "Use of manufactured fertilizers has been increasingly incorporated into regular farming practice in EU since its introduction in mid to late nineteenth century. In 2014, mineral fertilizer consumption in EU was 18 million tons. Given intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides, horticulture and vegetable growing are considered to be major contributors to some existing environmental impacts, such as water and soil pollution. Therefore farmers need to be aware and use only necessary amount of fertilizer for good plant development and to obtain high productions and to move from classical fertilization to organic fertilization. Cauliflower is not a pretentious culture but applying fertilizers can have a beneficial effect on production. Experience was carried out in 2016 in Apahida village, near Cluj-Napoca. It followed the effects of differentiated organic fertilization on three cauliflower hybrids: ‘Casper’ F1, ‘Cercy’ F1and ‘Charlot’ F1. Experiment was carried out in open field and was started with seedlings. Experimental factors were: hybrid and number of fertilizations. Each experimental factor had three graduations which combined resulted in a number of nine variants. During vegetation period, growth measurements were made and also the specific technology for autumn grown cauliflower in open field was applied.",
        "Introduction\nLate cardiovascular complications are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in patients treated for common malignancies of childhood. Late cardiotoxicity include increased development of atherosclerosis and atherosclerosis – related diseases. An evaluation of the endothelium can be made based on the measurement of endothelium-derived blood vasoactive factors, such as cytokines and adhesion molecules. Their elevated serum levels may serve as sensitive indicators of early atherosclerotic lesions in high risk patients. Currently, assessment of common carotid intima-media thickness has emerged as one of the more powerful tools for evaluation of subclinical atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study was to compare these parameters between patients after antineoplatic treatment compared to persons not exposed to such factors.\n\nMaterial and Methods\nEarly progression of atherosclerotic disease was evaluated in 64 survivors treated for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) in childhood, and in a control group of 36 healthy volunteers. Blood serum concentrations of selected new biomarkers, indicative of endothelial damage and inflammatory activity, were measured, including intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (E-selectin), thrombomodulin (TM), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). The common carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was also assessed via ultrasound examination.\n\nResults\nSignificantly higher blood concentrations of sICAM-1 adhesive molecule (229.3±62.2 ng/mL vs. 199.9 ± 63.3 ng/ mL, p=0.0072) and IL-6 (2.1 ± 2.7 pg/mL vs. 1.9 ± 3.6 pg/mL, p=0.0414) were found in ALL survivors compared with control subjects. Concentration of hs-CRP was also higher in the ALL group: 1.3 ± 2.2 ug/mL vs. 0.6 ± 0.9 ug/mL. This difference was close to statistical significance (p=0.0599). The mean IMT values for right and left carotid arteries were higher in ALL patients after antineoplastic therapy, compared with healthy subjects (IMT-R 0.056±0.008 mm vs. 0.052±0.003 mm; p=0.0021; IMT-L 0.057±0.009 mm vs. 0.052±0.003 mm; p=0.0051).\n\nConclusions\nSurvivors of childhood ALL in the examined group demonstrated elevated concentrations of selected new biomarkers and increased IMT values, compared to controls, which may confirm the occurrence of endothelial injuries in blood vessels. This study indicates that subjects treated for childhood malignancy are at a higher risk of prematurely developing atherosclerosis.",
        "Human settlements often originate from the presence of such natural sustaining water bodies as springs, rivers, or rather from the proximity of relevant infrastructure (roads, harbours, etc.). Rural residential buildings, however, are generally closely linked to the cultivated fields of a farm. A significant example of rural buildings, that particularly identifies some national or regional areas, is that of the Apulian farmhouses known as “masserie”, which are considered as an important cultural heritage in the rural territories of that region. These buildings, featuring relevant architectural and landscape characteristics, encompass several functions within them and often host more than one family living there permanently. Territorial distribution of rural buildings and farmhouses in Apulia is diversified and, in general and as already stated, it can depend on the close relationship between the building and its adjacent agricultural lot. Moreover, in the case of the Apulian farmhouses, owing to their specific role in overseeing the territory and asserting land tenure rights, this distribution may have “genetic” origins influenced by other elements, too. The efforts of the present work regarding this issue are to investigate the existing relationships between the Apulian farmhouses system and the “historical” roads already existing when they were built (XII-XIX centuries). Particularly, the study proved if there are any correlations among the Roman roads, the sheep’s paths (tratturi) crossing the Apulia region and the farmhouses, both from the point of view of the distance from the roads and the importance of the individual farmhouses. Using GIS software and overlay mapping procedures it was possible to quantify the amount of farmhouses and their concentration within the catchment areas of the aforementioned historical roads, while through historical and territorial in-depth analysis those elements characterizing the most interesting farmhouses from the historical and architectural point of view were identified. The research provided interesting information on the existing relations between historical roads and farmhouses, leading to further considerations on the possibility to enhance some of these monuments, located in rural areas, through the promotion of the “integrated” asset represented by the historical road system, with particular reference to the sheep’s paths (tratturi).",
        "Malnutrition is the cellular imbalancing among the supply of energy and nutrients which are essential for maintenance, growth and particular functions. It becomes a major cause of mortality of children less than five years of age. The aim of present study to evaluate the serum analytes such as electrolyte (sodium (Na+), potassium (K+) and calcium (Ca+)), creatinine and blood components in malnourished than healthy children. We had collected the data of 300 malnourished children (100 marasmus, 100 kwashiorkorand, 100 healthy children) with age 6-36 months from Children complex Hospital Multan, Pakistan. Data was analyzed by Paired sample t-test by SPSS software. Then socio-demographic data of their mothers was also collected. The result showed that level of Na+ and creatinine was high whereas, the levels of K+ and Ca+ were lower in both Marasmus and Kwashiorkor than control subjects. The levels of leukocytes, platelets and hemoglobin (Hb) were decreased in both diseases. Erythrocytes (RBCs) level was decreased in Marasmus while increased in Kwashiorkor. It is concluded that inadequate feeding practices, birth order, poverty, illiterate mothers, low nutritional quality of meals responsible for malnutrition. Feasible strategies are needed to address the dietary inadequacies and chronic malnutrition of rural infants.",
        "When an automatic milking system (AMS) is introduced on a farm the milking of cows and related work is changed in many ways compared to farms with traditional milking systems. The objective of this paper was to study the effect of the introduction of robotic milking in Finland on the composition and hygienic quality of milk. The study was carried out on three farms which were the first in Finland to introduce the automatic milking system (Volontary Milking System). Main chemical composition, somatic cell count, total bacteria count, freezing point, free fatty acids, as well as Bacillus cereus, Clostridium spores, psychrotrophic bacteria and coliforms were determined. After the introduction of the automatic milking system an increase in somatic cell count and total bacteria count, psychrotrophic bacteria and coliforms was observed; however, the differences were not statistically significant. The counts for Clostridium spores were at the same level in the automatic and the conventional milking system. Bacillus cereus counts were very low in both milking systems studied. Milk fat content and free fatty acids were elevated when AMS was introduced. The introduction of AMS resulted in a significant increase (P < 0.01) in the freezing point during the first three months. Though there was a trend that the overall quality of milk was impaired after the introduction of AMS, the quality of milk remained at premium class.;",
        "As scientists continue to discover convincing evidence that the earth’s climate is adversely changing, and that these changes could impact the habitat suitability of some wildlife species; wildlife conservationists are increasingly worried of what may become the fate of most species on earth. In the light of such uncertainty, geographic information systems (GIS) can be used as a tool to model for the habitat suitability of a species. Such modeling provides reliable information upon which decision making could be based for planning conservation management aimed at protecting areas that are currently suitable as well as those that may become suitable in future if the global climate changes according to the scenarios as described; and the changes impact the species’ habitat suitability. GIS in combination to Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) distribution model were used to model the habitat suitability for <i>Pan troglodytes ellioti</i> on Mount Fako (Cameroon) as a case study area. The results show that the predicted habitat suitability may shift from lower altitudes to higher altitudes as the global climate may change from the current climatic conditions to warmer climatic conditions in the future as proposed in the climate scenario that assumes the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases may double by 2050. The accuracy assessment measured in terms of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) was 0.699.",
        "Soil is a huge reservoir of water used by plants in periods without precipitation and significantly affects the hydrological balance of any territory. To evaluate the hydrological balance of any piece of the land given, it is therefore necessary to carry out the analysis of the hydro-physical conditions. To speed up and simplify the determination of basic hydro-physical properties of soil man developed and began to use the so-called pedotransfer functions (PTF). Comparison of domestic and foreign works, however, faces problems such as the definition of available water supplies in different countries. In the research project “Specification of the available supplies of nitrogen and water in the soil profile and determining the effective depth of crops’ roots” we have dealt with the selection of suitable pedotransfer functions necessary for basic agricultural production with the requirement of minimal amount of input data. For our research we chose several PTFs developed and used in the Czech Republic for a long time, with a minimum of input data, and several new PTFs from foreign authors with greater correlation, but also a greater need of input data, and we compared each other. The best correlation between values and the pedotransfer function for the field water capacity and for the wilting point seems to be the PTF according to Tomasella and PTF according to Batjes. Pedotransfer function according to Váša, in terms of volume of input data, appears better. ",
        "The objectives of this study were to determine and evaluate the effect of bull, diluter and addition of LDL in different concentration on the percentage rate of spermatozoa survival after cold shock. In total, four bulls were collected during a period of eight weeks. A total of 8 samples of fresh semen with required quality were processed. Three extenders were used for dilution of each sample; AndroMed®, Bioxcell® and Triladyl®, each in standard and LDL enriched variants. In the case of AndroMed® and Bioxcell®, 4, 6 and 8% of LDL were simply added. In Triladyl®, 6, 8 and 10% of LDL replaced the standard egg yolk component. Resistance of spermatozoa against cold shock (0 °C, 10 minutes) was evaluated by the percentage rate of live sperm using Eosin-Nigrosine staining immediately and 2 hours after heat incubation (37 °C). The results showed the influence of bull individuality as an important factor. Among diluters used it is possible to recommend AndroMed® and Bioxcell® due to significantly (P &lt; 0.01) lower decline of live sperm proportion during the cold shock test than Triladyl® (-9.19, respectively -4.95%). The optimal LDL concentration increasing resistance of spermatozoa against cold shock was not determined, therefore subsequent research is necessary.",
        "Introduction\nDespite significant recent advances in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), most cases of the disease are still incurable. Treatment with monoclonal antibodies, such as ofatumumab, is one of the new therapeutic options.\n\nObjective\nRetrospective analysis of the efficacy of ofatumumab in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) treated in the Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Department of the Medical University of Lublin, Poland, during 2011–2013.\n\nMaterial and Methods\nThe analysis included 5 patients (3 women and 2 men), aged 47–65, with Rai stage II-IV CLL, after a few lines of treatment. Three patients received ofatumumab in monotherapy and 2 patients received ofatumumab in combination with cyclophosphamide (50 mg/day) and dexamethasone (40 mg/day). All patients included in the study were diagnosed with an active form of leukaemia with symptoms such as lymphocytosis or massive lymphadenopathy.\n\nResults\nAll patients responded to the treatment. Within the first 8 weeks of the treatment, levels of white blood cells returned to normal in patients with baseline lymphocytosis (3 patients). An increase in platelet levels was reported in 3 patients. Haemoglobin levels were higher or comparable to the baseline values in all studied patients after the completion of immunotherapy. In the patient with massive lymphadenopathy and hepato- and splenomegaly, the size of the lymph nodes, spleen and liver decreased and neutrophil levels increased. Time of progression was 5–12 months, and in one patient partial remission has been maintained. The treatment was well-tolerated in most cases. Asymptomatic neutropenia and an infection with Candida glabrata were observed.\n\nConclusions\nOfatumumab may be a new and safe therapeutic option for patients with CLL after a few lines of treatment.",
        "A 2 × 4 factorial experiment was conducted with 80 growing-finishing pigs to evaluate effects of barley storage (stored barley harvested the previous year or freshly harvested barley) and supplemental vitamin E (0, 40, 80 or 160 mg/kg as all-rac-a-tocopheryl acetate) on pig performance and the storage stability and eating quality of frozen pork. Pigs were fed isoenergetic barley-soybean meal diets and vitamin E was rationed on the top of feed, a 2-d dose at a time. Stored and freshly harvested barley contained 33.5 and 31.2 mg/kg of vitamin E in the beginning and 33.0 and 38.7 mg/kg at the end of the study, respectively. Supplemental vitamin E had a quadratic effect on pig growth (P < 0.05), the greatest weight gains being observed with 40 mg/kg of supplemental vitamin E in both barley diets. Vitamin E supplementation increased linearly serum (P < 0.001) and quadratically back fat a-tocopherol (P < 0.01). Plasma gluthathione peroxidase activity increased as pigs grew older (P < 0.001), and at slaughter it decreased linearly with supplemental vitamin E (P < 0.05). Dietary vitamin E supplementation did not affect the content of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) or the organoleptic quality of pork stored frozen (-18°C) for 16 weeks. The TBARS content of pork increased with time (0 to 8 d) thawed meat was displayed under fluorescent light at 8°C (P < 0.001) which was detected as a poorer taste. In conclusion, supplemental dietary vitamin E above 40 mg/kg feed does not improve pig performance nor the storage stability or eating quality of frozen pork when freshly harvested or stored barley from good harvest conditions is fed to growing-finishing pigs.;",
        "Average annual precipitation (AAP) is one of the principal environmental factors that regulates processes in terrestrial ecosystems. The effect of AAP on the availability of edaphic nutrients is poorly understood, especially in tropical zones with high rainfall. In order to evaluate the effects of high AAP on the availability of soil N, P, and K, physicochemical parameters were measured in soils of three tropical rainforests in the Chocó biogeographical region with different AAPs (7,500, 8,000, and 10,000 mm yr-1). Furthermore, a bibliographical review was carried out that including studies for distinct tropical Ultisols and AAP ranging from 1,800 to 10,000 mm yr-1. The evaluated soils presented extreme acidity with high contents of Al, organic matter (OM) and total N, and low quantities of P, Mg, and Ca. The K concentrations were intermediate and the effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) was low. On the other hand, in the evaluation of the influence of the AAP on the availability of N, P, and K in the soil, contrasting tendencies were observed. On one side, a positive curvilinear relationship was found between the availability of N and the increase in the AAP. On the other side, the available P content significantly decreased with increasing AAP. In conclusion, the excessive AAP resulted in increases in total N and low availability of P, thereby altering the dynamics of the nutrients and the carbon balance of the tropical forest",

        "There were cheeses produced from raw cow’s milk and from mixed milk compared. Mixed milk contained small ruminants’ milk (goat’s and ewe’s milk) and cow’s milk in different proportions. There were technological, physical and health parameters, mineral composition, microbiological indicators and sensory quality evaluated. Cow’s milk, compared to mixed milk, contained markedly lower amounts of fat, protein, casein, total solids, solids non fat, urea and acetone and higher values of lactose, citric acid and free fatty acids and showed significantly lower values of somatic cell count. Mixed milk showed lower (better) results for freezing point depression, markedly higher titration acidity and higher values ​​for Ca, Mg, K, P, Cu, Mn and Zn. The results of microbiological analyses confirmed good hygienic quality in terms of total count of mesophlic, psychrotrophic and thermoresistant bacteria and coliforms. Negative incidence of L. monocytogenes and mostly negative incidence of S. aureus are important results and confirmed high quality of raw material for cheese production. None of S. aureus strains were confirmed as MRSA. The results of sensory evaluation showed no significant differences between cheeses originated from cow’s milk and cheeses from mixed milk.",

        "Projected changes in weather parameters, mainly temperature and rainfall, have already started to show their effect on agricultural production. To cope with the changing scenarios, adoption of appropriate management strategies is of paramount importance. A study was undertaken to evaluate the most appropriate combination of sowing date and phosphorus fertilization level for peanut crops grown in sandy loam soil in a subhumid region of eastern India. Field experiments were conducted during the summer seasons of 2012 and 2013 on peanut crops at the farm of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. The DSSAT v4.5 CROPGRO-Peanut model was used to predict the phenology, growth, and yield of peanut crop under combinations of four sowing dates and four phosphorus fertilization levels. The model was calibrated with a 2012 dataset of growth, phenology, and yield parameters for estimating the genetic coefficients of cultivar TMV-2 and was validated with a 2013 dataset of the same parameters. Simulations of pod yield and other yield parameters using the calibrated model were found to be quite accurate. The model was able to reasonably simulate pod yield and final biomass with low normalized root mean square error (RMSEn), low absolute root mean square error (RMSEa) and high coefficient of determination (R2 > 0.7) over a wide range of sowing dates and different phosphorus fertilization levels sensitivity analysis indicated that sowing from the second week of January to the end of February with 30–50 kg P2O5 ha−1 would give the highest pod yield.",

        "The aim of this work is to evaluate the sustainability, in terms of greenhouse gases emission saving, of a new potential bio-ethanol production chain in comparison with the most common ones. The innovation consists of producing bio-ethanol from different types of no-food grapes, while usually bio-ethanol is obtained from matrices taken away from crop for food destination: sugar cane, corn, wheat, sugar beet. In the past, breeding programs were conducted with the aim of improving grapevine characteristics, a large number of hybrid vine varieties were produced and are nowadays present in the CRA-VIT (Viticulture Research Centre) Germplasm Collection. Some of them are potentially interesting for bio-energy production because of their high production of sugar, good resistance to diseases, and ability to grow in marginal lands. LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) of grape ethanol energy chain was performed following two different methods: (i) using the spreadsheet “BioGrace, developed within the “Intelligent Energy Europe” program to support and to ease the RED (Directive 2009/28/EC) implementation; (ii) using a dedicated LCA software. Emissions were expressed in CO2 equivalent (CO2eq). The results showed that the sustainability limits provided by the normative are respected to this day. On the contrary, from 2017 this production will be sustainable only if the transformation processes will be performed using renewable sources of energy. The comparison with other bioenergy chains points out that the production of ethanol using grapes represents an intermediate situation in terms of general emissions among the different production chains.",

These models are suitable only for simulation of physical fields movements in wood but not for educational purposes especially demonstration of microscopic structure of wood.3D structure of ring-porous hardwood species was created. European ash (Faraxinus excelsior L.) was selected due to its relatively simple wood structure than other wood species within ring-porous group. The model was created by manual modelling process in Rhinoceros 4.0 that is a software for visualization and modelling. Microslides were prepared from sample of ash to take micro photos that were used as a visual source for modelling. Beside these pictures made by authors of this paper other microphotos from wood anatomy publications were used. Created 3D model of ash is a VRML object (Virtual Reality Modelling Language). This format is available to viewing and presentation with severe freeware VRML browsers. These VRML browsers are available as a plug-in for standard internet browsers or as standalone VRML browsers. The model is useful for studying and teaching microscopic structure of ring‑porous hardwood species. It was created such a way to be as exact copy of original anatomical structure of ash wood as possible. The paper may be used as a cue for other authors to create their own 3D models of different wood kinds.",
        "This research was carried out in the milk production plants for 10 weeks (5 during the dry season and 5 during the rainy season in Medellín, Colombia). Samples of raw (fresh) milk were taken from Holstein cattle and fresh farmer cheese was produced through enzymatic coagulation. For the milk and the cheese, the physicochemical characteristics and nutritional quality, were evaluated for both seasons.\nFor parameters such as the casein and the ash content, the non-fat milk solids showed a confidence interval that fluctuated between 8.3% and 8.7% (with an α=0.05), which is comparable to that reported by the Colombian legislation; however, unusual results were identified within the registered periods, especially at the transition period between rainy and dry period (7.89% non-fat solids). The obtained yield averages were significantly higher in regards to those reported by various authors, while those found for the other studied parameters had results similar to those proposed in the literature.\nThe evaluation and determination of high nutritional value factors in food, such as the protein percentage and the essential amino acids profile, allow for the improvement of quality based milk payment systems that can be applied nationwide and that are based on the initial proposal of Fedegan and the Republic of Colombia",
        "This study uses a combination of remote sensing data, field interviews and observations, and landscape indices to examine the dynamics of land use and land cover (LULC), identify their driving forces, and analyze their effects on the landscape of Abaya-Chamo Basin (ACB) between 1985, 1995, and 2010. The results reveal that the landscape of ACB has changed considerably during the past 25 years between 1985 and 2010. The main changes observed imply a rapid reduction in shrubland (28.82%) and natural grassland (33.13%), and an increase in arable land (59.15%). The basin has become more fragmented and formed less connected patches in 2010 compared to 1985. Rapid population growth, internal migration, policy shifts, and regime change were identified as the key driving forces of LULC changes in ACB. The LULC changes and related trend of increasing landscape fragmentation in the basin increased soil erosion, the volume of surface runoff, and sediment transport in the landscape and, consequently, affected the levels and water quality of the lakes found in the rift floor. Furthermore, the destruction and fragmentation of shrubland and natural grassland led to the decline of wild plants and animals previously prominent in the basin. Therefore, protective measures that take into consideration the economic, social, and ecological dynamics of the basin are urgently needed to save the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems of the basin from further damage.",

        "The aim of the study was to evaluate the genetic diversity in Holstein bulls population in Slovakia by the methods of pedigree analysis. The population was represented by the bulls with reserve of frozen semen doses in AI centers. Whole reference population consisted of 169 bulls born from 1997 to 2009. For calculation of diversity parameters the program Endog v.4.8 (Gutiérrez, Goyache, 2005) was used. An average maximal number of generations traced was 9.35, 3.06 complete generations and equivalent number of generations traced was 5.71. An average coefficient of inbreeding was 2.48%, individual increase in inbreeding was 0.53% and average relatedness was 2.72%. The 167 bulls from 169 were inbred (98.82%). An average number of offsprings per bull was 107.70 with maximal number 1,641 offsprings. The effective population size computed via individual increase in inbreeding was 94.50. The effective number of founders was 88, effective number of ancestors 31 and only 13 ancestors described 50% of diversity. From these results we can conclude that the diversity of Holstein bulls is reduced by more factors (inbreeding, high relatedness, bottlenecks). Obtained results point out the need to use new outbred bull lines for mating cows.",
        "Introduction\nIntentional poisonings among children and adolescents are a problem not only for paediatricians, but also constitute a big issue for public health. In many countries worldwide, including Poland, an increase has been observed in suicidal behaviours at developmental age.\n\nObjective\nThe aim of the study was a retrospective evaluation of patients hospitalized due to intentional poisoning in the Department of Paediatrics, Children’s University Hospital in Lublin, Poland, in 2007–2012.\n\nMaterial and Methods\nIn the study period, 149 patients were hospitalized in the Paediatric Department of the Children’s University Hospital in Lublin, due to intentional poisoning with medicines or other chemical substances. The study group comprised 135 girls and 14 boys; The majority of patients (n=105) were urban inhabitants, and only 44 lived in the rural areas. Medical records were analyzed, with consideration of medical, psychological and psychiatric examinations.\n\nResults\nGirls constituted as much as 90.6% of the study group. The majority of patients lived in urban areas – 70.46%. A total of 16.77 % of patients came from incomplete families. Alcohol problem occurred in 19 families. The most frequent cause of a suicide attempt was conflict in the family, followed by school problems. During the 6-year-study period, an upward tendency in the incidence of intentional poisoning was observed, particularly in the first 4 years.\n\nDiscussion and conclusion\nSuicide attempts in adolescents were mostly undertaken by girls from the urban environment. The majority of those attempts were caused by family problems, including alcoholism.",
        "Since occupational accidents often occur in farm tractor drivers, it is extremely important to focus the attention on specific devices in order to avoid risks from tractor overturning. This phenomenon is actually considered as the leading cause of deaths or injuries related to agricultural work. The system adopted to reduce the above-mentioned risk consists of passive protection devices aimed at preventing the hazardous event which may affect workers’ health. More precisely, the tractor chassis (i.e. ROPS) and the proper seat belt define a “safety volume” around the worker. The aim of the present research is to carry out tests on narrow-track wheeled tractors with fixed roll over protective structures in those areas – such as hazel and olive groves and vineyards - where problems related to under–tree activities occur. This is to implement planting layout and/or cultivation techniques which can be considered suitable for tractors with roll over protective structures. According to that, their project parameters – i.e. safety volume, seat position and typology, test methods - can be successfully modified and improved. The results show that nowadays only a few agricultural vehicles are provided with specific fixed devices able to work under tree without damaging orchards.",
        "The release of CO2 from the snow surface in winter and the soil surface in summer was directly or indirectly measured in three different soil types (peat, sand and clay) in agricultural ecosystems in Finland. The closed chamber (CC) method was used for the direct and Fick's diffusion model (DM) method for the indirect measurements. The winter soil temperatures at 2-cm depth were between 0 and 1°C for each soil type. The concentration of CO2 within the snowpack increased linearly with snow depth. The average fluxes of CO2 calculated from the gradients of CO2 concentration in the snow using the DM method ranged from 10 to 27 mg CO2 m2 h -1 and with the CC method from 18 to 27 mg CO2 m -2 h -1. These results suggest that the snow insulates the soil thermally, allowing CO2 production to continue at soil temperatures slightly above freezing in the winter. Carbon dioxide formed in the soil can move across the snowpack up to the atmosphere. The winter/summer ratio of CO2 evolution was estimated to exceed 4%. Therefore, the snow-covered crop soil served as a source of CO2 in winter, and CO2 evolution constitutes an important part of the annual CO2 budget in snowy regions.;",
        "Immediately after ovulation, in the follicular cavity, by multiplying and metaplasia of granulosa and internal sheath cells, a transient endocrine gland is formed, known as the corpus luteum (corpus luteum). Although in adult mice, ovulation occurs every 4-5 days throughout the year and important individual variations were noticed in terms of the normal estrous cycle, formation, progression and regression of corpus luteum are somewhat synchronized. This paper proposes a cytohistological study of the ovary of adult mice to capture the main morphological changes which occur in the process of organization, evolution and involution of the corpus luteum in this species. The investigations were performed on adult mouse ovaries of NMRI line, in various stages of the estrous cycle. They were fixed in 10% formalin, then were sectioned 5μ in size and were stained with Mallory trichrome method. Luteal morphology emphasizes that, after the loss of oocyte, follicular cavity shrinks due to the wrinkling of sheaths, then is filled with blood and lymph resulting initially the bleeding body (corpus hemorrhagicum). Cell differentiation takes thus place on a blood-cytolitic support, which is reabsorbed, and in the parenchyma of corpus luteum two types of luteal cells can be identified (large and small).",
        "Follicular atresia is a process commonly encountered at ovarian level that limits the number of ovulations and, respectively, the reproductive potential of a female. Ovarian cells death is essential for maintaining homeostasis of this organ and is based on an apoptotic mechanism that ensures selection of the dominant follicle and the disappearance of follicles in excess. The present study evaluates the incidence of morphological changes specific for this process in the prepubescent mouse ovary by applying optical microscopy techniques. Microscopic analysis was performed on sections of ovarian tissue from mice females line NMRI aged 14-17 days. The results show, at this age, significant morphological changes at cellular level, specific for apoptotic process, as condensation and fragmentation of the genetic material, vacuolization of cell cytoplasm, destabilization of cell adhesion junctions and appearance of wide intercellular spaces, invasion of spaces created with leukocytes infiltrated, formation of apoptotic bodies.",
        "Although iodine is not essential for plants, they take it up readily and, in foodchains, are significant sources of iodine for organisms with an essential requirement for it. During several nuclear accidents radioiodine has been an important component of releases of radioactivity and has caused serious contamination of foodchains. Differences in iodine uptake by different plant taxa are, therefore, important to nutritional and radioecological studies. Using techniques we have developed for a range of other elements, we analyzed inter-taxa differences in radioiodine uptake by 103 plant species and between varieties of two species, and analyzed them using a recent, phylogenetically-informed, taxonomy. The results show that there are significant differences in uptake above and below the species level. There are significant differences between Monocots and Eudicots in iodine uptake, and, in particular, hierarchical ANOVA revealed significant differences between Genera within Families. These analyses of the taxonomic origin of differences in plant uptake of iodine can help the prediction of crop contamination with radioiodine and the management of stable iodine in crops for nutritional purposes.",
        "Welding of metal materials belongs to non-demountable joints. Current trend especially in an automotive industry is to join materials with a different melting temperature. Most of all, there are dural profiles with ferrite or austenite steel. The reason for this is the effort to lower the weight of the whole construction and at the same time preserve sufficient mechanical characteristics. However, there is a big risk of different electrical potentials of both of these metals in this type of non-demountable joints. The experimental part of this paper brings evaluation of mechanical-corrosion processes of overlapped joints produced by the CMT (cold metal transfer) method. The base material for weld bead is dural sheet AlMg3 and dural sheet with a surface treatment aluzinc DX51D+AZ 150. Material AlSi5 in the form of a wire was used as an additional material for a welding bath. Method CMT was used in order to create a weld bead. Initial analysis of weld bead was done visually using a binocular microscope. Further, a metallographic analysis of weld bead and base material was processed. The aim was to identify the heat affected area around the welded joint. Microhardness of intermetallic aluminium phases was measured, after the identification of intermetallic phases a chemical analysis EDS was processed. Prepared samples underwent corrosion degradation in a salt spray environment in compliance with the norm ČSN EN ISO 9227. Visual and metallographic evaluation of the individual samples was processed after every week of exposition to the salt spray environment. The goal of this experiment was to record the initial impulse of galvanic corrosion which consists in corrosion degradation in the area of welded joint. ",

This calculation is absolutely necessary to be predetermined and properly distributed, so that in winter, the animals have required amount of food to survive, in order to develop and reproduce normally. Supplementary food is given only in winter, especially when snow prevents hunting to feed. Complementary food comes, as the name implies, to complement the very poor diet of the animals. The amount of complementary food is based on its quality of each species.",
        "The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a mono-component commercial serine protease supplement in broiler diets on apparent ileal amino acid digestibility and protease activity. A total of 150 male (28 d old) ROSS 308 were randomly placed into 30 battery pens and divided into 5 treatment groups with 6 replicates each. The experiment was performed for 7 days. Five dietary treatments were used: 2 standard protein diets without (SP) and with protease (SP + P) formulated 20.7 % CP, 2 lower-protein diets (19.9 % CP) without (LP) and with protease (LP + P) and one lower‑protein diet with protease and with doubled rapeseed meal (RSM) content (SP-RSM + P) compared with the other treatments. Lower-protein diets were formulated with a 4 % decrease in the relative CP value compared with the standard protein diet. Enzyme protease was added to the diets at a concentration of 200 ppm (15,000 PROT units per kg). The diets contained 0.3 % Cr2O3 to facilitate the estimation of apparent AA digestibility and overall apparent ileal crude protein digestibility. Mono-component protease had no effect on apparent ileal AA digestibility or jejunum protease activity if diets contained the same level of RSM. The supplement of exogenous protease did not affect (P &gt; 0.05) the apparent ileal AA digestibility coefficients if a higher RSM level was used. The CP level influenced (P &lt; 0.05) only the coefficients of the apparent ileal AA digestibility of Pro and Arg. The RSM level (P &lt; 0.01) had significant effects on protease activity in the jejunum.",
        "In this experiment we have studied the effect of cellulosic categories from combined forages with sunflower meal on nutritive and bioproductive indices at broiler chickens. The experiment was carried out on 90 broiler chickens divided in three experimental groups: CG, EG1 and EG2. At control group was incorporated in combined forage 20% barley, at EG1 was incorporated 20% barley and 10% sunflower meal of good quality (36% CP) and at EG2 was incorporated 20% barley and 10% sunflower meal of poor quality (27% CP). At the age of 3 and 6 weeks were determined the nutritive and bioproductive indices. The highest forage consumption is registered at CG at which in the structure of combined forages was incorporated barley in proportion of 20% and was with 12.02% higher comparative with EG1 and with 5.9% higher comparative with EG2. The incorporation of barley and sunflower meal in the structure of combined forages fed to broiler chickens determines the reduction of body weight with 11.18% at EG2 and with 9.55% at EG1. The highest specific consumption is registered at EG2 and is with 6.52% higher comparative with control group.",
        "Fruit quality is a very important objective because the consumers have increasing demands for high quality plums, where as it depends of the morphological and organoleptic characteristics of the fruit (shape, size, background color and coverage, color and consistency of the pulp, juiciness, taste, flavor, etc.), as well as technological, biochemical and nutrition value of them. Fruit size is expressed most often by weight or fruit diameter. The study took place in two fruit-growing ecosystems Călacea-Sălaj County and Cluj-Napoca County (at Agroindustriala fruiting tree farm) respectively, and were analyzed 7 varieties of plum in total. Determinations regarding the influence of thinning have been made for these varieties on fruit weight (g) and fruit diameter (mm). Following the chemical treatments for thinning, the highest percentage of fruit with a diameter bigger than 35 mm, in fruit-growing ecosystem Călacea-Sălaj County, was obtained for Stanley cultivar, after the treatment with Cosavet, while in Cluj-Napoca fruit-growing ecosystem, the highest percentage of fruit with a diameter bigger than 35 mm was obtained also for Stanley cultivar, but after the treatment with Ethrel. The highest fruit weight in fruit-growing ecosystem Călacea-Sălaj County was recorded for Stanley variety, after the treatment with Cosavet products (60.2 g), Sulfomat (49.6 g) and Ethrel (48.28 g); in fruit-growing ecosystem Cluj-Napoca, the highest fruit weight was recorded for Nectarină Roșie variety, after the treatment with Cosavet products (57.8 g) and Sulphur (57.8 g).",
        "The aim of present study was to evaluate the effect of purslane extract on performance, cecal microflora composition and immune responses of broiler chickens. One hundred and ninety two 1–day old broiler chicks (Ross 308) were allocated randomly in 4 groups with 4 replicates to receive diets supplemented with 0 (control), 100, 200 and 300 ppm of purslane extract for 42 days. Body weight gain, feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio were measured weekly and calculated for starter (1-21 d), grower (22-42 d) and overall periods (1-42 d). All diets were isocaloric, isonitrogenous and provided ad libitum. Antibody response against sheep red blood cell (SRBC) was measured on d-28 and d-42. At the age of 42 d, eight chicks per treatment killed aseptically for enumeration of cecal bacteria. The results of this experiment indicated that FI increased significantly with inclusion of purslane extract in grower and overall period (p≤0.05). Purslane extract did not affect coliform and Escherichia coli populations but increased Lactobacillus population of cecal content significantly (p≤0.05). There were no significant differences in primary and secondary antibody titer against SRBC and no differences among the treatments for relative weight of thymus and spleen (p&gt;0.05). Relative weight of bursa was affected with inclusion of purslane extract in the diet. Therefore, it was concluded that purslane inclusion had a positive significant effect on cecal microflora composition, but had no effect on immune response of broiler chickens.",
        "An increasing trend was observed over the last years in the modelling of soil-plant-management interactions of protected crops, mainly as an adaptation of approaches originally developed for field crops. The variety of modelling approaches used world-wide reflects the difficulty of unifying physiological principles across various crops (plant types). The heterogeneity of software development techniques (typically based on procedural principles) has been another obstacle to the progress of research in this field, since it hampered model extension and re-usability. This paper describes and discusses the scientific basis, the design, implementation and perspectives in modelling greenhouse crops. Generic modular architectures developed according to up to date software technologies (.NET, Java) were identified and proposed as valuable for the design, implementation, verification and comparison of process-based modelling approaches. On this basis, the authors argue that the combination of good software engineering with sound crop science can enhance the rate of advance in crop modelling for protected crops.",

In the next experiment, we checked the mycelial growth on the same medium but at 3 different pHs. MEA medium ensured the highest growth rates for all the strains under test, followed by PDA. Pery-G strain showed the fastest growing rate on MEA (5.79 mm day-1) and PDA (3.04 mm day-1), respectively. Test concerning the mycelium growth on PDA at different initial pH values (5.5, 6.0, 6.5) showed the preference of our P.eryngii strains for media with weak acid to the neutral reaction , the optimal values being 6.0. There were no big differences among mycelium growing rates of the same strain for the three pH variants",
        "Nets are commonly used for agricultural applications. However, only little is known about the radiometric properties of net types and how to influence them. In order to investigate the influence of net construction parameters on their radiometric properties, a set of radiometric tests were performed on 45 types of agricultural nets. Laboratory tests on large size net samples was performed using a large and a small integrating sphere. Open field radiometric test were carried out by means of an experimental set up (120x120x50 cm) and a full scale shade house. Small differences (less than 5%) occurred between laboratory and open field tests. Results highlighted that the porosity and the mesh size, combined with the colour and secondarily, with the fabric and the kind of threads of the net influenced the shading performance of the net. The colour influenced the spectral distribution of the radiation passing through the net absorbing its complementary colours. Since nets are three-dimensional structures the transmissivity of direct light under different angles of incident of solar radiation changes when installed in the warp or weft direction. Transmissivity could be considered one of the main parameters involved in the agronomic performances of the netting system.",
        "The watercress (Nasturtium officinale R. Br.) is often grown as a forced leaf vegetable rich in vitamins and minerals. Its specific taste and curative effects result from the presence of mustard glycosides (glucosinolates) that may also show nematocidic effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of watercress eluate and juice on tomato plants inoculated with the northern root-knot nematode (NRKN) Meloidogyne hapla. It was found out that after the treatment of plants with solutions derived from watercress the yield of fruit was highly significantly increased. The highest yield increase (by 96 % to 165 %) was observed in the variant with the highest concentration of watercress extracts (macerate + 200 ml of juice). Although at lower concentrations of watercress solution the increase in yields was also reduced (by 57–118 %), the difference was still statistically highly significant. The effect of this treatment on the content of vitamin C was similar and the increase was also highly significant and ranged from 24 to 67 %. When evaluating the occurrence of nematodes on roots of tomato plants, the presence of pathogens was equal to zero percent in all treated variants. The treatment with this phyto-solution corroborated not only a nematocidic effect of watercress but also its positive influence on the yield and level of vitamin C in dependence on increasing concentrations of the effective agent. It can be therefore concluded that the watercress solution showed a promoting effect on tomato plants.",
        "The objective of this study was to determine the effect on goat kids of\r\nsupplementation with protein–xanthophyll concentrate (PX) obtained\r\nfrom alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i>). Assessments\r\nwere made on carcass dressing percentage and the lipid profiles of\r\nmuscle tissue. When the animals reached 30 days old (the start of\r\nthe fattening period), they were allocated to two feeding groups:\r\na control group (K), which received a standard concentrate diet, and\r\nan experimental group (D), which was fed a modified control diet\r\nwhere 3 % of the soybean meal was replaced with an alfalfa\r\nprotein–xanthophyll preparation (PX). For the rest of the study the\r\nkids had ad libitum access to dam milk, hay and their\r\nrespective diets. After 90 days of rearing (from the end of the\r\nfattening period up to when the kids were approximately 120 days of\r\nage), five (male) kids were randomly selected from each group and\r\nslaughtered.  Overall, PX supplementation in goat kids does not\r\naffect any parameters of fattening, such as slaughter weight, daily\r\nweight gains or dressing percentage. However, beneficial effects of\r\nfeeding with PX concentrate were found in a higher loin percentage\r\nand improved tissue composition resulting from lower fat tissue\r\ncontent. Moreover the PX dietary supplement improved the chemical\r\ncomposition of the muscle tissue by increasing the content of\r\nprotein and unsaturated fatty acids. Taken together, our results\r\nsuggest that supplementing the fattening diet for goat kids with the PX\r\npreparation did not affect the quantitative parameters of fattening but\r\nhad a positive influence on the quality of carcass composition.",

        "The understanding of multiple effects by possible future development is essential for adapted land use planning. This study assessed the potential of land use scenarios for the provision of ecosystem services using local knowledge in two districts of northern Ghana. Local knowledge was gathered through surveys with extension officers, who are regarded as eligible knowledge holders for agricultural land use. Firstly, ecosystem services that were perceived as important by the stakeholders were identified, namely food, fodder, energy, construction materials, marketable products, water provision, and erosion control. Quantitative indicators were then determined to analyze the capacity of land use types to supply the ecosystem services. Land use scenarios were developed based on their applicability and capacity to mitigate climate change impacts. The perception of stakeholders was applied to evaluate changes in ecosystem services provision by the scenarios. A modeling approach for a spatially explicit simulation was used to assess the potential to provide ecosystem services at a district level. The results reflected the different trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services of each scenario, depending on the district. Along with the local perception, characteristics of land use patterns also influenced the regional potential of ecosystem services provision.",
        "Forage ensilability mainly depends on dry matter (DM), water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) and buffer capacity (BC) values at harvest time. According to these parameters, and based on a collection of 208 forages of known ensilability characteristics including short and long term meadows for grazing, italian ryegrass, maize, triticale, soybean, faba bean crops, and samples coming from cereal-legume associations, the objective of this study has been to define a quantitative ensilability index (EI) based on a relationship between DM, WSC and BC contents at harvest date, adapted to the characteristics of fodder from wet temperate areas. For this purpose, a discriminant procedure was used to define this EI based on a linear combination of DM, WSC and BC of forages at harvest time. The quantitative calculated indexes distinguish five successive ranges of ensilability: high ensilability (EI&gt;+28), medium high ensilability (+9&lt;EI&lt;+28), medium ensilability (-28&lt;EI&lt; +9), medium low ensilability (-47&lt;EI&lt;-28) and low ensilability (EI&lt;-47).

        "Europe is characterised by a rich net of itineraries that during the Middle Ages were taken by pilgrims head toward the holy places of Christianity. In Italy the main pilgrimage route is the <em>Via Francigena</em> (t<em>he road that comes from France</em>), which starts from Canterbury and arrives in Rome, running through Europe for about 1800 km. Municipalities and local associations are focused on purposes and actions aimed at the promotion of those routes, rich in history and spirituality. Also for the European Union the enhancement of those itineraries, nowadays used both by pilgrims and tourists, is crucial, as shown by the various projects aimed at the identification of tools for the development of sustainable cultural tourism. It is important to understand how landscape, that according to the European Landscape Convention reflects the <em>sense of places</em> and represents the image of their history, has evolved along those roads, and to analyse the relationships between the built and natural environments, since they maintain a remarkable symbolic connection between places and peoples over time and history. This study focuses on the Italian section of the <em>Via Francigena</em> that crosses the Emilia-Romagna region, in the province of Piacenza. A land classification method is proposed, with the aim to take into account different indicators: land zoning provided by regional laws, elements of relevant historical and natural value, urban elements, type of agriculture. The analyses are carried out on suitable buffers around the path, thus allowing to create landscape profiles. As nature is a key element for the spirituality character of these pilgrimage routes, the classification process takes into account both protected and other valuable natural elements, besides agricultural activities. The outcomes can be useful to define tools aimed to help pilgrims and tourists to understand the surrounding places along their walk, as well as to lend support to rural and urban planning and integrated local development and landscape enhancement projects.",

The aim is to evaluate the impacts of economic development on the life situation of households from a specific point of view. The period represents one phase of the economic cycle in Europe – it is characterized by economic boom as well as declines leading to current crisis. Data was obtained from the Statistical Office of the European Communities. Subjects of analysis were individual European countries and groups EU 27 and EU 15. Using the cluster analysis method it was found that there are certain groups of countries with similar structures of household expenditures. These groups were relatively stable over time and corresponded to the traditional perception of similarity between countries in terms of geographical, cultural, political, etc. factors. However, some exceptions occurred – e.g. position of Ireland close to South European countries or Estonia close to Central European countries. Results serve as a basis for evaluation of economic development and can be also used as an indicator of impacts of economic development on people’s living situation.",
        "Precious biological characteristics of rabbits make their breeding a very profitable occupation. The rabbit meat, organoleptically same to the white meat, is rich in proteins, but low in fats. Biological researched done in direction to elucidate the biochemical systems that are the basis for organism physiological processes, have revealed that the level in which this process are develop directly influence the rabbits productivity capacity. 60 rabbit’s heads was used as biological material, distributed in: 15 Californian, 15 New Zeeland White, 15 Grand Chinchilla and 15 F1NZCH hybrids obtained from cross-breeding the New Zeeland White as maternal form and Grand Chinchilla as paternal form. Blood was sampled from the rabbit and was biochemical analyzed. The studied indices were: total protein, albumin, urea, uric acid, creatinine, total bilirubine, cholesterol, triglyceride and glucose. The experimental lot formed from F1 NZCH hybrids registered a concentration of 2.1 mg/dl uric acid, and in the other three lots the concentration was under 2 mg/dl. In all four lots, uric acid value was in normal limits. The determined creatinine registered very low values, under 1 mg/dl, at the low limit of reference values. At hybrids from New Zeeland White as maternal form and Grand Chinchilla as paternal form, in equal environmental conditions, the serum biochemical analysis haven’t registered significant differences compared to pure breeds individuals.",
        "This article focuses on spatial structure of one hundred largest enterprises in the Czech Republic from evolutionary perspective. The location of large enterprise headquarters in the Czech Republic and its implications for country’s economic spatial profile and unevenly distributed economic power is discussed thoroughly. The whole analysis is pragmatically accomplished at the level of self-governmental NUTS III regions. As it is shown, intense concentration processes in the location of largest enterprise headquarters were observed during the analyzed period between 1995 and 2010. The capital city with its surroundings proved to be the winners of this process. Currently, the spatial pattern of afore mentioned head offices is basically stabilized. On the other hand, weight of large enterprises of many regions is almost negligible and subsequently, rank of individual regions can be rather volatile. Generally speaking, economic map of the Czech Republic is not entirely in compliance with country’s settlement system. Simultaneously, fundamental factors determining the location of large enterprise head offices are evaluated also from qualitative perspective. Traditional hard location factors, such as infrastructure, geographical location or agglomeration economies turned out to be decisive for location decision-making. Apart from Prague, headquarters of large enterprises tend to prefer other big towns in the country, such as Brno, Ostrava, Olomouc, Hradec Králové or Plzeň. ",
        "Genetic parameters of Montbeliarde cows were estimated for test-day milk yield with a random regression spline model. The spline model has been considered as a good alternative to Legendre polynomials to direct interpretation of parameters. With this model the lactation curve is divided into sections by knots. The milk yield between any two knots is assumed to be changing linearly. The random regression was fitted with linear splines with five knots: 7, 54, 111, 246, 302. The herd-test-day is the fixed effect of the model. The heritability estimates for test-day milk yield ranged from 0.346 at 65th day in milk, to 0.422 at 35th day in milk. Genetic correlations between individual test days were positive and tended to decrease with an increase in days between when the yields were measured. Random regression models using linear splines were proved to be useful for genetic evaluations of cows.",
        "To succeed in artificial insemination and to produce the fecundation in cows it isnecessary to have knowledge about optimal time of ovulation. Such possibilityappears using the values of electrical resistance of cervical mucus. The smallestvalues are obtained during the ovulation due to the pH modification influenced by theestrogens. The purpose of the paper was to determine the electrical resistance of thecervical mucus in cows with clinical signs of estrus, depending on females’ age. Also,the electrical resistance of the cervical mucus in cows in different physiologicalstages (pregnant, no pregnant) was measured. The ovulation detector DRAMINSKIwas used. This equipment allows to obtained a quickly and precise rapport on thephysiological stage of the cow. It can be detected the cow with atypical ovulation,irregular ovulation. This method improve the insemination efficiency, allowsdetecting early gestation period or the moment of ovulation. All these have a positiveinfluence on the development strategy of the farm and improve the economicperformances.",
        "High population as well as the economical tension emphasises the necessity of effective city management – from land use planning to urban green maintenance. The management effectiveness is based on precise knowledge of the city environment. Point clouds generated by mobile and terrestrial laser scanners provide precise data about objects in the scanner vicinity. From these data pieces the state of the roads, buildings, trees and other objects important for this decision-making process can be obtained. Generally, they can support the idea of “smart” or at least “smarter” cities.Unfortunately the point clouds do not provide this type of information automatically. It has to be extracted. This extraction is done by expert personnel or by object recognition software. As the point clouds can represent large areas (streets or even cities), usage of expert personnel to identify the required objects can be very time-consuming, therefore cost ineffective. Object recognition software allows us to detect and identify required objects semi-automatically or automatically.The first part of the article reviews and analyses the state of current art point cloud object recognition techniques. The following part presents common formats used for point cloud storage and frequently used software tools for point cloud processing. Further, a method for extraction of geospatial information about detected objects is proposed. Therefore, the method can be used not only to recognize the existence and shape of certain objects, but also to retrieve their geospatial properties. These objects can be later directly used in various GIS systems for further analyses.",
        "Residue chopping from orchard pruning is becoming a common practice in conservation agriculture after the establishment of eco-conditionality policies in the European Union. This type of residue is used to protect the soil from erosion and improve the water balance and fertility of soils by improving the organic matter content. However, no studies have evaluated the influence of pruning residues and size on soil coverage. This study examines the effect of different treatments on pruning residue soil coverage in an olive orchard (cv. Picual). Treatments consisted of two quantities of pruning residues, specifically, high (2.04 kg m-2) and low (1.02 kg m-2), and two chopping speeds, low (2.4 km h-1) and high (3.2 km h-1). The different treatments were evaluated by image analysis and pixel counting to determine the soil cover percentage, size, number and distribution of the pruning residues after chopping. After chopping, the soil cover percentage was 39% higher in the high quantity pruning residue treatments but was not significantly influenced by the chopping speed. The size and number of lignified residues was quantified via pixel counting. In the high quantity pruning residue treatments, the number of large lignified residues (&gt; 6 cm2) was higher, and the number of pruning residues smaller than 2 cm2 was lower, when compared with low quantity pruning residue treatments. The high chopping speed treatments produced more smaller-sized pruning residues.",
        "\nThe high rates of rumen fermentation, physical breakdown and passage rates from the rumen of legume silages lead to higher intakes than for grass silages of comparable digestibility. Although total tract digestibilities for legume silages and maize silages are often lower than for grass silages, milk yields are usually higher. A further benefit of legumes and maize is the reduced rate of decline in digestibility. Legume silages often lead to a reduction in milk fat concentration and increased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, 18:2 n-6 and 18:3 n-3. This latter effect is related to reduced rumen biohydrogenation as a consequence of increased rumen passage rates or the effects of polyphenol oxidase. There is quite a wide range of maturities (300 – 350 g kg-1 DM) that leads to maximum dry matter intakes and milk production from maize silage; milk production is reduced with immature or over–mature maize crops. Forage chop length exerts a number of effects, both in the silo and in the rumen, but effects on rumen function, feed intake and milk production have been inconsistent. The high protein content and high N degradability of most legume silages is associated with a low efficiency of converting dietary N into milk N, with a concomitant increase in urine N. Reducing N intake by inclusion of maize silage in mixtures with legume silages leads to a marked reduction in urine N without loss of production potential. It is predicted, on the basis of their chemical composition and rumen kinetics, that legume silages and maize silages would reduce methane production relative to grass silage, though in vivo measurements are lacking. Extensive fermentation in the silo reduces the amount of fermentable substrate, and reduced methane production in comparison with grass silage where fermentation had been restricted by high levels of acid additive.\n",
        "Harvester technologies of timber logging currently represent the high spot of technologies used in forestry for timber harvesting and forwarding. A typical feature of the “harvester– forwarder” combination is production rate, which is many times higher than in the commonly used technology of “power chainsaw–tractor” (Lukáč, T., 2005). Other major features prevailing in harvester technologies include an appreciably high level of work hygiene and a significant reduction of environmental burden, which is certainly beneficial for the environment.Harvester technologies of timber logging are currently an integral part of sustainable forest management.This paper focuses on finding options for the application of harvester technologies in selected entities based on the analysis of selected factors that can be greatly affected by the technologies.",
        "The aim of the work was to analyze the changes in the epidemiology of salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis diseases in Slovakia over the past 10 years and evaluate them in the context of epidemiological changes comparing to the EU. Salmonellosis (A020) and campylobacteriosis (A045) belong to the diseases with the highest morbidity in Slovakia. For the period 2001–2010 was reported in Slovakia 109 304 salmonellosis cases in human and 3 327 cases of Salmonella carriage. The five-year EU-trend (2005–2009) showed a statistically significant decrease of salmonellosis disease (with a mean reduction of 12% per year). Campylobacteriosis remains a long time the most frequently reported zoonotic disease in humans in Slovakia as well as in EU. For the period of 2001–2010 25 574 campylobacteriosis cases was reported in Slovakia. Most diseases were reported in 2010 with the number 4 591 (84.63 morbidity/100 000 inhabitants). Increase in morbidity is evident since 2003 with an average annual increase of 22%. We focused on more in-depth epidemiological analysis of salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis cases in Slovak Republic in relation to the infection agens and the outbreak of disease transmission mechanism, age and gender, location and seasonality of disease.

        "The research presented in this paper aimed at the study of three native chickpea cultivars, as follows: the chickpea cultivars Burnas, Rodin, and Cicero 1. We set our experiments on a cambic, moist phreatic (poorly gleyed), poorly decarbonated chernozem on loessoid-dusty, clayish-loamy deposits of the experimental field of the Didactic Experimental Station of the Banat University of Agricultural Science and Veterinary Medicine in Timişoara (Timiş County, Romania). Among the experimental chickpea cultivars, the chickpea cultivar Burnas is to be noted for its mean yield in all three fertilisation rates: 2,994 kg/ha. The chickpea cultivar Rodin comes second, the difference between the two being very significant. Establishing fertilisation rates for the chickpea cultivars mentioned above is extremely important since biological materials were developed in different soil and climate conditions from the research area and from the area in which they are to be cultivated. The lowest yield was in the chickpea cultivar Cicero 1, the mean for the three fertilisation rates being 1,945 kg/ha. As for the fertilisation rates, the fertilisation variants N50P60K60 and N100P60K60 resulted in a very significant increase.",
        "The chemical composition of the meat is one of the most important characteristics. For the fish meat quality there are only few specific data comparatively with those that exist about animal meat. The results obtained from a study done on the meat quality of the fish specie Clarias gariepinus (African catfish) with a body weight of around 1200 – 1550g are presented in this paper. The obtained results emphasized a great quality of the Clarias gariepinus meat. The meat proteins content had a big value and it was indirectly proportional to the body weight. The meat hydration was higher in fishes with low body weight and indirectly proportional to the fat content. Taking in consideration the fat content of this meat, it can be concluded that the African catfish could be included in the half fat fish category. The meat caloricity calculated is growing proportionally to the body weight, being influenced by the fat content.",
        "Vineyards are usually managed by tilling the inter-rows to avoid competition from other plants for soil water and nutrients. However, in humid and sub-humid climates, such as that of NW Spain, cover crops may be an advantage for controlling vine vegetative growth and improving berry composition, while reducing management costs. The current study was conducted over three consecutive growing seasons (2012-2014) to assess the effects of establishing three permanent cover crop treatments on water relations, vine physiology, yield and berry composition of a vineyard of the red cultivar ‘Mencía’ (<em>Vitis vinifera </em>L.) located in Leiro, Ourense. Treatments consisted of four different soil management systems: ST, soil tillage; NV, native vegetation; ER, English ryegrass (<em>Lolium perenne</em> L.); and SC, subterranean clover (<em>Trifolium subterraneum</em> L.). Midday stem water potential was more negative in the native vegetation treatment, causing significant reductions in leaf stomatal conductance on certain dates. Total vine leaf area and pruning weight was reduced in the cover crop treatments in the last year of the experiment. Yield was unaffected by the presence of a cover crop. No significant differences among treatments were observed for berry composition; however, wines were positively affected by the SC treatment (higher tannin content and colour intensity and lower malic acid concentration when compared with ST). Wines from the cover crop treatments were preferred by taste panelists. These results indicate that in humid climates cover crop treatments can be useful for reducing vine vegetative growth without compromising yield and berry quality.",
        "The pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) is very important and valuable freshwater fish in Hungary. The quality of lash is very high (white, tasty and boneless) thus the gastronomically demand grows year by year. Besides the pikeperch is an attractive game fish and as a top predator, plays an important role in the maintenance of ecological balance in freshwater ecosystems. The success of pond culture of pikeperch depends on the propagation and nursing methods. Recently the technological development of artificial reproduction ensures the production of more fry and fingerlings. Present study investigates the different reproduction methods in consideration of the spawning behaviour of the pikeperch breeders. Between the hormone treatment and spawning there were observed six stagers in the behaviour of pike-perch couples- In addition to the observations on behaviour of spawning, various hormone products were examined in order to stimulate and synchronise the ovulation of pike perch breeders. Best results were recorded in case of using dried carp pituitary as a hormone treatment (170g eggs/stripped females), while the treatment with GnRH analogs resulted 145 g respectively. Moreover the price and biological advances of GnRH analogs require more research in their use in the field of artificial propagation of pikeperch. These hormones do not interfere violently the neuro-humoral regulation of the ovulation, thus contributes to maintain better conditions of animal welfare during the propagation procedure.",
        "Percid fishes, including pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) have recently become the subject of intense research. In order to obtain gynogenetic all female pikeperch populations, normal pikeperch eggs are fertilized with inactivated sperm. Because pikeperch semen has a high viscosity, milt has to be diluted in an immobilizing solution before DNA inactivation. The aim of this study was to assess milt diluting solutions effectiveness in order to inactivate sperm DNA with UV irradiation, to produce meiotic gynogenetic pikeperch (Sander lucioperca). We assessed sperm motility after dilution in 5 different immobilizing solutions. Best results were obtained using Ringer’s solution as pikeperch sperm diluent.",
        "The paper was aimed on reforming on damage to soil caused by passage of universal wheeled tractors and forest wheeled tractors. We focused mainly on determining the changes in CO2 content in soil after its compaction in comparison with unimpaired soil from the stand. We carried out the measurements in municipal forests of Stará Turá, in four stands, where a regeneration felling was done. We acquired data on the depth of ruts through the method of transversal profiles took samples of soil from the ruts and unimpaired stand to determine the bulk density and moisture content. We determined the content of CO2 in stand and ruts with a Vaisala MI70 device. We selected the stands so that they would be uniform in age, terrain incline, terrain, and soil type. All of the stands had a low bearing sub – soils – flysch sandstone. This affected the rut depth after both machines passage. Rut depth indicated severe damage to the stand soil. We also observed severe differences in CO2 content of the compacted soil. Measurements in all of the stands showed a significant increase in CO2 content after its compression. Unimpaired soil reaches volume of 0.3% and rut soil reaches 1.8%. The compressed soils contained 6x the CO2 of uncompressed soils. The results of statistical analysis show, that moisture content affects the CO2 content more than bulk density. Coeficients of correlation between CO2 and moisture content were r = 0.68 and 0.52 and between CO2 and balk density were r = 0.26 and 0.36. Increase in moisture content causes CO2 accumulation. Combined effects of these two characteristics are significant and show very strong correlation. There was for example r = 0.83 and independent characteristics influenced dependent on 69%.From the outcomes the measurements we can state, that the passage of mechanisms causes significant changes in the stand soil.",
        "Introduction\nThere is a lack in the worldwide literature of reports on the Neuromarkers of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in patients after bilateral hand amputation The aim of this study was to test a hypothesis regarding developing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in a patient after bilateral hand amputation with the use of Event Related Potentials (ERPs). On the basis of previous research, the amplitudes of P3 ERP components elicited in the cued GO/NOGO tasks have been chosen as candidates for neuromarkers of PTSD.\n\nCase study\nA 24-year-old patient had undergone bilateral hand amputation 12 months previously. The patient was repeatedly operated on (he had undergone successful bilateral hand replantation) and despite the severity of the injuries, he recovered. However, the patient complained of flashbacks, anxiety and sleep difficulties. Specialist tests showed the presence of PTSD. The patient participated in the cued GO/NOGO task (Kropotov, 2009) with recording 19-channel EEG. P3 GO and NOGO waves in this task were found to be significantly smaller, in comparison to a group of healthy control subjects of the same age (N=23) taken from the HBI normative database (https://www.hbimed.com/). This observed pattern of ERP waves in the patient corresponds to the pattern found in PTSD patients.\n\nConclusions\nERPs in a GO/NOGO task can be used in the assessment of the functional brain changes induced by chronic PTSD.",
        "Natural toxins, such as mycotoxins, have emerged as a significant factor affecting the safety image of cereal grains as a raw material for the food and feed industry. The aim of the present study was to investigate the contents of trichothecenes in representative samples of oats during official variety, nitrogen fertilization and organic farming trials in Finland, 19971999. Further objectives were to promote industry and commerce by selection of high-quality oat varieties for various applications. The official variety trials conducted at 810 locations were managed following standard protocol. There were 2 types of agronomy trial, the first included comparison of oat cultivars grown in conventional and organic farming systems at 6 locations, and the second used 5 nitrogen rates (0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 kg N ha-1) at 2 locations. Regardless of wet cold summer occurring in Finland during 1998, the concentrations of Fusarium toxins were lowest during this 3 year monitoring period. More mycotoxins were produced during the warm, dry summers of 1997 and 1999 than in 1998. In all, 55% of the oat samples in the official variety trials contained deoxynivalenol (DON) within the range of 50 896 µ g kg-1. The differences in DON concentrations between organic and conventional cultivation were small. The results showed also that the use of various nitrogen fertilization levels only slightly affected the trichothecene concentrations. The contents of trichothecenes in Finnish grains appeared to be similar to or lower than those reported earlier in the Northern Hemisphere.;",
        "Defense of desiccated cotyledonary somatic embryos and mature zygotic embryos of Abies numidica was tested in vitro by dual cultures with tester, fungus Phaeolus schweinitzii. Both types of embryos expressed defense reactions manifested by inhibited growth of fungal tester towards the embryos. Mycelial growth was described by logistic sigmoid growth model with a single asymptote. Mutual comparisons of mycelial growth in presence of zygotic and somatic embryos showed significant differences in parameters of mycelium growth curves towards the embryos. Larger defense reactions were observed in zygotic embryos relative to somatic embryos and unlimited control cultivations without embryo. The possible role of auxin in the defense response of plant embryos is discussed.",
        "The aim of this study was to characterise the population size, the properties of endangered national breeds of geese on area of Slovakia and preconditions of these breeds for their future sustainable development in Slovak Republic. The Slovak White Geese was breeding from original regional geese from South-Western Slovakia area with used by heavy and medially heavy German and Hungarian breeds of geese. A breeding basis of the Suchovska geese was comprised of brownish-yellow geese from Suchá nad Parnou that was progressively crossbreed with German (Pomorany, Steinbach) and French origin geese breeds (Toulouse, Landes). Obtained results were used to estimate a genetic diversity and define a genetic distance between Slovak White Geese and Suchovska Geese. We can conclude that value of genetic distance between Slovak White Geese and Suchovska Geese is 0.01834, genetic diversity is very small and we can expect communal origin of these geese breeds. The risk factor of national geese breeds is a low number of Slovak White Geese and Suchovska Geese controlled flocks and this created more pressure on the breeders and poultry judges at the exhibitions and the recognition of controlled flocks.",
        "The paper describes the income analyses and consumer demand analyses for foodstuffs, mainly meat and meat products of the childless and households with more maintained children in SR. Following the carried out analysis we can state that compared with the childless families the expenditures for foodstuffs in families with maintained children are by 40 % lower for commodities such as meat, fish, fruits, vegetables. Potatoes only reach a 50 % share in childless households. The demand for meat in total was price elastic within all groups of households (Epi = −1.01 to −1.57) and for pork the price elastic demand was observed only with one maintained child (Epi = −1.292) and in households with three and more maintained children (Epi = −1.179). The demand for poultry with regard to the change of the own price (Epi= −1.011) and emoluments (EI = 1.001) developed proportionally.",
        "One of the recently most popular ways of experiencing the past is time travelling. It is ‘an experience and social practice in the present that evokes a past (or future) reality’ (Holtorf 2009: 33). In this article, I mainly discuss the political aspect of time travelling. I focus on cinema as a medium which closely links archaeology with the time travel phenomenon. Two Oscars galas, of 2010 and 2012, are scrutinised as case studies. The text is a political intervention to start dreaming dangerously, to contribute as an archaeologist to the critique of the utopia of capitalism (see also Hernando 2005: 75).",
        "Recent developments in archaeological thought and practice involve a seemingly disparate selection of ideas that can be collected and organized as contributing to an anti-authoritarian, “punk” archaeology. This includes the contemporary archaeology of punk rock, the DIY and punk ethos of archaeological labor practices and community involvement, and a growing interest in anarchist theory as a productive way to understand communities in the past. In this article, I provide a greater context to contemporary punk, DIY, and anarchist thought in academia, unpack these elements in regard to punk archaeology, and propose a practice of punk archaeology as a provocative and productive counter to fast capitalism and structural violence.",
        "As an orchestra or a rock star, archaeologists have their audience too. This paper wants to highlight an integrated approach between fieldwork, its account and its dissemination to the public in different ways, including social media. This potential integration has come to life in the 2011 excavation of the Roman mansio of Vignale (Italy) and it has been named “Excava(c)tion”. It doesn’t mean a new way of digging but another way of approaching the excavation, an approach integrated toward and with the public, both on site and on the social Web. “Excava(c)tion” conceives the site as a stage and digging as a performance, through a continuous dialogue between archaeologists and the public. Archaeologists share their work in the form of guided tours (live, theatrical-like performances), communicative diaries and videos (edited, motion-picture performances) and on a blog (www.uominiecoseavignale.it). They receive back comments and oral accounts from the local community about the main themes of common interest. “Excava(c)tion” means engagement both of archaeologists and the public in the pursuit of a global multivocality during archaeological excavation.",
        "This paper forms part of a wider PhD project exploring whether there can be an informative research relationship between archaeology and oral history. Its focus is on the working class housing experience in the North of England during the Industrial Revolution period. Oral history as a discipline applied within archaeological investigation is growing in popularity and in application in the UK as a form of ‘community archaeology’. Evidence suggests that there is potential for combining the memories of oral history testimonies and the physical archaeological evidence from excavation to enhance our understanding of an event, person, time and place. However, establishing what evidence of the housing experience survives in an archaeological context and what survives in memory is crucial to the success of a combined investigative approach. This paper will use the example of The Public Archaeology Programme of the site Dixon’s Blazes as a relevant example in which to explore this, with evidence of sanitation, overcrowding and architecture surviving in both.",

The likely requirement that books should be OA if submitted to the REF (Research Excellence Framework) after next means that OA development must be based on an understanding of the importance of the monograph in the AHSS (arts, humanities and social sciences) as well as the challenges involved in making the transition to online OA. The project focused on three issues and each is summarized in turn in the article: What is the place of the monograph and other long-form publications in AHSS disciplines that makes it so important? What is happening to the monograph and is there a crisis as some suggest? What are the issues involved in moving monographs into a digital and OA environment – not just the challenge of effective business models but also many other aspects of sustaining and enhancing the qualities of the monograph?

        "This study compares the flows of mobile researchers and the number of publications in international collaboration within the context of scientific and economic capacities. The goal is to identify the convergence or discrepancy of countries in mobility and collaboration and determine the positions and relative influence of countries in both processes. Using affiliation data from scientific publications, we analyze the distributions and networks of collaboration and mobility and their structural differences. The results show that there is a significant relationship between the flow of mobile researchers and the capacity for publishing with foreign partners in the more prolific countries, although mobility is always lower than collaboration. Size matters and scientific relationship are highly resource-dependent. Advanced and Proficient countries accumulate the highest proportion of the mobile authors and international publications with an extremely low representation of mobility in Developing and Lagging countries. In addition, the placement of countries is not always consistent in both networks, revealing distinct roles of mobility and collaboration, with particular instability for lower income countries. The more resources available in a country (both scientific and economic) the greater the likelihood of attracting foreign partners and mobilizing human capital. The policy relevance of these structural differences are described and a brief description of the limitations and future research are provided.",

Propagation of authoritative and enhanced data about e-resources has the potential to benefit all actors in the supply chain from publishers to libraries. GOKb can also serve as a platform to explore how open knowledge base data can contribute to the broader scholarly community infrastructure, particularly around open access (OA).",

Long-term Preservation of these data and of the ability to discover, access and process them is a fundamental issue and a major challenge at programmatic, technological and operational levels.<br /><br />Moreover these data are essential for scientists needing broad series of data covering long time periods and from many sources.

Therefore it is of primary importance not only to guarantee easy accessibility of historical data but also to ensure users are able to understand and use them; in fact data interpretation can be even more complicated given the fact that scientists may not have (or may not have access to) the right knowledge to interpret these data correctly.<br /><br />To satisfy these requirements, the European Space Agency (ESA), in addition to other internal initiatives, is participating in several EU-funded projects such as CASPAR (Cultural, Artistic, and Scientific knowledge for Preservation, Access and Retrieval), which is building a framework to support the end-to-end preservation lifecycle for digital information, based on the OAIS reference model, with a strong focus on the preservation of the knowledge associated with data.<br /><br />In the CASPAR Project ESA plays the role of both user and infrastructure provider for one of the scientific testbeds, putting into effect dedicated scenarios with the aim of validating the CASPAR solutions in the Earth Science domain. The other testbeds are in the domains of Cultural Heritage and of Contemporary Performing Arts; together they provide a severe test of preservation tools and techniques.<br /><br />In the context of the current ESA overall strategies carried out in collaboration with European EO data owners/providers, entities and institutions which have the objective of guaranteeing long-term preservation of EO data and knowledge, this paper will focus on the ESA participation and contribution to the CASPAR Project, describing in detail the implementation of the ESA scientific testbed.",
        "This paper reviews how usability has been defined in the context of the digital library, what methods have been applied and their applicability, and proposes an evaluation model and a suite of instruments for evaluating usability for academic digital libraries. The model examines effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, and learnability. It is found that there exists an interlocking relationship among effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. It also examines how learnability interacts with these three attributes.",
        "The main goal of this work is to verify the existence of diverse behavior patterns in academic production and impact, both among members of the same scientific community (inter-author variability) and for a single author (intra-author variability), as well as to find out whether this fact affects the correlation among author-level metrics (AutLMs) in disciplinary studies. To do this, two samples are examined: a general sample (members of a discipline, in this case Bibliometrics; n = 315 authors), and a specific sample (only one author; n = 119 publications). Four AutLMs (Total Citations, Recent Citations, Reads, and Online mentions) were extracted from three platforms (Google Scholar Citations, ResearchGate, and ImpactStory). The analysis of the general sample reveals the existence of different performance patterns, in the sense that there are groups of authors who perform prominently in some platforms, but exhibit a low impact in the others. The case study shows that the high performance in certain metrics and platforms is due to the coverage of document typologies, which is different in each platform (for example, Reads in working papers). It is concluded that the identification of the behavior pattern of each author (both at the inter-author and intra-author levels) is necessary to increase the precision and usefulness of disciplinary analyses that use AutLMs, and thus avoid masking effects.",

Those challenges are changing the eScience paradigm, mainly regarding digital preservation and scientific workflows. To address specific concerns with data management in these scenarios, the concept of the Data Management Plan was established, serving as a tool for enabling digital preservation in eScience research projects. We claim risk management can be jointly used with a Data Management Plan, so new risks and challenges can be easily tackled. Therefore, we propose an analysis process for eScience projects using a Data Management Plan and ISO 31000 in order to create a Risk Management Plan that can complement the Data Management Plan.

        "Stamp collectors frequently donate their stamps to cultural heritage institutions. As digitization becomes more prevalent for other kinds of materials, it is worth exploring how cultural heritage institutions are digitizing their philatelic materials. This paper begins with a review of the literature about the purpose of metadata, current metadata standards, and metadata that are relevant to philatelists. The paper then examines the digital philatelic collections of four large cultural heritage institutions, discussing the metadata standards and elements employed by these institutions. The paper concludes with a recommendation to create international standards that describe metadata management explicitly for philatelic materials.",
        "Objective: This research study sought to determine the formats (print or electronic) of articles and book chapters most-preferred by first-year medical students, third-year medical students entering clinical clerkships, and incoming residents and to determine if these preferences change during the course of the medical curriculum. These trends will enable academic health sciences libraries to make appropriate collection development decisions to best cater to their user populations.\n\nMethods: First-year medical students, third-year medical students, and incoming medical residents were asked to complete a paper survey from September 2014 to June 2015. The survey consisted of five multiple-choice questions, with two questions given space for optional short answers. Quantitative and qualitative responses were collected and calculated using Microsoft Excel.\n\nResults: First-year students, third-year students, and incoming residents all preferred to read journal articles and book chapters in print, except in cases where the article or book chapter is under ten pages in length. Although print is preferred, demand for electronic articles and book chapters increases as students progress from undergraduate medical education into residency. The only category where a majority of incoming residents chose an electronic resource was which format they would give to a colleague, if the article or book chapter was critical to the care of an individual patient.\n\nConclusions: The preference for print resources is strong across the medical curriculum, although residents show an increased preference for electronic materials when compared to first- and third-year students. Academic health sciences libraries should take these preferences into account when making decisions regarding collection development.",

        "Digital data are accumulating rapidly, yet issues relating to data production remain unexamined. Data sharing efforts in particular are nascent, disunited and incomplete. We investigate the development of data products tailored for diverse communities with differing knowledge bases. We explore not the technical aspects of how, why, or where data are made available, but rather the socio-scientific aspects influencing what data products are created and made available for use. These products differ from compact data summaries often published in journals. We report on development by a national data center of two data collections describing the changing polar environment. One collection characterizes sea ice products derived from satellite remote sensing data and development unfolds over three decades. The second collection characterizes the Greenland Ice Sheet melt where development of an initial collection of data products over a period of several months was informed by insights gained from earlier experience. In documenting the generation of these two collections, a data product development cycle supported by a data product team is identified as key to mobilizing scientific knowledge. The collections reveal a co-evolution of data products and designated communities where community interest may be triggered by events such as environmental disturbance and new modes of communication. These examples of data product development in practice illustrate knowledge mobilization in the earth sciences; the collections create a bridge between data producers and a growing number of audiences interested in making evidence-based decisions.",

        "Abstract\r\n\r\nObjective – In the context of the ongoing discourse about the role of Institutional Repositories (IRs), the objective of the study is to investigate if there is any evidence of a relation between undergraduate student activity in an IR and the impact of faculty research. \r\n\r\nMethods – The data used for the study is representative of six academic departments of the College of Science and Mathematics (CSM) at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly). Digital Commons@Cal Poly (DC) is the IR supported by the library. Regression analysis was used to investigate the interdependence between faculty research impact (dependent variable) and undergraduate student repository activity (independent variable). For each department, faculty research impact was quantified as a measure of the citation counts for all faculty publications indexed in Web of Science (WoS) between January 2008 and May 2017. Student repository activity was quantified for each department in two ways: (1) total number of student projects deposited in DC since 2008 (Sp) and (2) total number of student project downloads from DC (Sd). The dependent variable was regressed against each of the two elements of student repository activity (Sp and Sd), and the resulting statistics (sample correlation coefficients, coefficients of determination, and linear regression coefficients) were calculated and checked for statistical significance. \r\n\r\nResults – The statistical analysis showed that both components of student repository activity are positively and significantly correlated with the impact of faculty research quantified by a measure of the citation counts. It was also found that faculty repository activity, although positively correlated with faculty research impact, has no significant effect on the correlation between student repository activity and faculty research impact. \r\n\r\nConclusion – The analysis considers two distinct groups of publications: one group of student publications (senior projects) from six academic departments, which are deposited in an open repository (DC), and one group of publications (not necessarily represented in DC) of faculty affiliated with the same six departments and whose citation impact is believed to be affected by the first group. The statistical correlation between student repository activity and faculty research impact can be seen as an indication that an active, open IR centered on collecting, preserving, and making discoverable student research output has a positive impact on faculty’s research impact. More research that includes additional factors and uses a larger data set is necessary to arrive at a definitive conclusion.",

        "Conventional approaches to processing records of linguistic origin for storage and retrieval tend to regard the data as immutable. The data generally exhibit great variety and disparate frequency distributions, which are largely ignored and which entail either the storage of extensive lists of items or the use of complex numerical algorithms such as hash coding. The results in each case are far from ideal.\n The variety-generator approach seeks to reflect the microstructure of data elements in their description for storage and search, and takes advantage of the consistency of statistical characteristics of data elements in homogeneous data bases.\n In this paper, the application of the variety-generator approach to the description of personal author names from the INSPEC data base by means of small sets of keys is detailed. It is shown that high degrees of partitioning of names can be obtained by key-sets generated from the initial characters of surnames, fmm the terminal characters of surnames, and from the initials.\n The implications of the findings for computer-based bibliographical informationsystems are discussed.",

        "In the fall of 2004, the Academic Computing Center, a division of the Information Technology Services Department (ITS) at Minnesota State University, Mankato took over responsibility for the computers in the public areas of Memorial Library. For the first time, affiliated Memorial Library users were required to authenticate using a campus username and password, a change that effectively eliminated computer access for anyone not part of the university community. This posed a dilemma for the librarians. Because of its Federal Depository status, the library had a responsibility to provide general access to both print and online government publications for the general public. Furthermore, the library had a long tradition of providing guest access to most library resources, and there was reluctance to abandon the practice. Therefore the librarians worked with ITS to retain a small group of six computers that did not require authentication and were clearly marked for community use, along with several standup, open-access computers on each floor used primarily for searching the library catalog. The additional need to provide computer access to high school students visiting the library for research and instruction led to more discussions with ITS and resulted in a means of generating temporary usernames and passwords through a Web form. These user accommodations were implemented in the library without creating a written policy governing the use of open-access computers.",

        "We investigated how bibliometric indicators such as publication count and citation count affect the assessment of research performance by computing various bibliometric scores of the works of Korean LIS faculty members and comparing the rankings by those scores. For the study data, we used the publication and citation data of 159 tenure-track faculty members of Library and Information Science departments in 34 Korean universities. The study results showed correlation between publication count and citation count for authors with many publications but the opposite evidence for authors with few publications. The study results suggest that as authors publish more and more work, citations to their work tend to increase along with publication count. However, for junior faculty members who have not yet accumulated enough publications, citations to their work are of great importance in assessing their research performance. The study data also showed that there are marked differences in the magnitude of citations between papers published in Korean journals and papers published in international journals.",
        "International collaboration makes up an increasing, high citation-impact share of research output, but the UK’s collaboration with key partners is threatened by its decision to leave the EU. Data show that about 85% of US and UK international collaboration is with only one or two partners, usually among other “leading” research economies. Although highly multinational research (10 or more authors) is growing more rapidly than total research output, it actually remains scarce (about 1% of all collaboration) among the established research economies. Analysis also shows that the “citation bonus” contributed by international collaboration is in fact both specific and limited; it should, therefore, be interpreted with some care. For example, citation impact trends look different for two-country and multi-country collaborations involving the same countries. Impact also increases but then plateaus with increasing numbers of partners. Further, we find that massively multinational papers are of such a different kind that we suggest they should be excluded from standard citation analysis.",

        "Abstract\r\n\r\nObjective – Student research habits and expectations continue to change, complicating the design of library spaces and the provision of research support. This study’s intent was to explore undergraduate and graduate student research and study needs at a mid-sized university’s two campuses in the Northeastern United States, and to improve librarians’ understandings of these practices so that more appropriate services and spaces may be developed to support student learning.\r\n\r\nMethods – The research project utilized a primarily qualitative design for data collection that spanned from fall 2012 to summer 2013, consisting of an online questionnaire, unobtrusive observations, and in-depth semi-structured interviews. Data collection commenced with a questionnaire consisting of 51 items, distributed through campus email to all students and receiving 1182 responses. Second, 32 hours of unobtrusive observations were carried out by librarians, who took ethnographic “field notes” in a variety of Library locations during different times and days of the week. The final method was in-depth interviews conducted with 30 undergraduate and graduate students. The qualitative data were analyzed through the application of a codebook consisting of 459 codes, developed by a data analysis team of 4 librarians.\r\n\r\nResults – The results address topical areas of student interactions with librarians, contact preferences, and use of library space. Of the interviewees, 60% contacted a librarian at least once, with texting being the most popular method of contact (27%). In being contacted by the library, students preferred a range of methods and generally indicated interest in learning about library news and events through posters and signage. Participants were less interested in receiving library contact via social media, such as Facebook or Twitter. Regarding student use of and preference for library space, prominent themes were students creating their own spaces for individual study by moving furniture, leaving personal items unattended, the presence of unwanted noise, and a general preference for either working nearby other students in groups or in carrels to facilitate individual study.\r\n\r\nConclusions – Being aware of student research processes and preferences can result in the ability to design learning environments and research services that are more responsive to their needs. Ethnographic research methods, as part of an ongoing research process, are recommended as a means to better understand library user practices and expectations.",

This in turn has led to a demand for staff development on the successful incorporation of ICT in education (Smith and Oliver, 2000). In HE, there have been a number of targeted funding initiatives such as the Computers in Teaching Initiative (CTI) and the current third phase of the Teaching and Learning Technology Programme. This latter programme focuses on embedding learning technologies rather than developing software products, leading to generic projects on the implementation of ICT in education. As these projects aim for cross-institutional transferability, there seems no reason why - although carried out in the context of HE - they should not be widened to address the needs of the FE sector.",
        "The intent of this study was to investigate 93 doctoral candidates&#x2019; perceptions and use of an online collaboration workspace and content management server, Microsoft Office SharePoint, for dissertation process.

Descriptive statistics demonstrate that candidates frequently use SharePoint for a variety of reasons, including assisting them in sharing and gaining information, improving the flow and organisation of the dissertation process and collaborating with their advisors mentors, in the dissertation process. Results of the multivariate analysis of variance demonstrated that doctoral students&#x2019; who extensively use SharePoint have significantly higher student-to-student connectedness and student-to-advisors connectedness than doctoral students who use it moderately and on a limited basis. Additional results revealed that sense of connectedness and satisfaction are positively associated with the different features of SharePoint. Since using SharePoint to facilitate the mentorship during the dissertation process is positively associated with connectedness and satisfaction, it may positively influence completion and time to completion of a doctoral programme.",
        "While digital virtual worlds have been used in education for a number of years, advances in the capabilities and spread of technology have fed a recent boom in interest in massively multi-user 3D virtual worlds for entertainment, and this in turn has led to a surge of interest in their educational applications. In this paper we briefly review the use of virtual worlds for education, from informal learning to formal instruction, and consider what is required to turn a virtual world from a Multi-User Virtual Environment into a fully fledged 3D Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). In this we focus on the development of Sloodle &#x2013; a system which integrates the popular 3D virtual world of Second Life with the open-source VLE Moodle. Our intent is not simply to provide additional learning support features for Second Life, but to study more generally the ways in which integrated virtual environments can benefit teaching and learning, and this is the focus of our closing discussion.",

        "Web-based delivery of support materials for students has proved to be a popular way of helping small teams to implement key skills policies within universities. The development of 'key' or 'transferable' skills is now encouraged throughout education, but resources (both in terms of staffing and budget) tend to be limited. It is difficult for key skills teams to see learners face to face, and not feasible to print or distribute large amounts of paper-based material. Web-based delivery presents a means of overcoming these problems but it can result in generic study skills material simply being published online without due consideration of the needs of different groups of learners within different subject disciplines. Therefore, although a centralized Website for skills provision can overcome logistical problems, it may be perceived as irrelevant or unusable by the student population. This paper presents a model for Web-based delivery of support for key skills which incorporates two separate approaches to the design of these resources. The model was implemented as part of a wider key skills pilot project at University College London, over a period of one year. It includes a 'core' Website, containing information and resources for staff and students. These can also be accessed via customized, departmental key skills homepages.

It then draws some wider conclusions about the effectiveness of this design for supporting skills development.",
        "In this study, we followed three faculty members&#x0027; experiences with designing and teaching online courses for the first time. In order to complete the activity, the faculty members had to work collaboratively with others across the university. Activity theory provided a framework within which to study faculty members&#x0027; collaborative activities with members of different activity systems that had different goals, tools, divisions of labor and accountabilities. In concordance with activity theory, such differences led to contradictions, disturbances, and transformations in thinking and work activities. The results of the study have implications for individuals and systems undertaking technology integration in teaching.",
        "Academic developers of online courses may not have experienced this mode of learning and teaching from the learner perspective. This article makes a comparison between suggestions for online course design from research literature and user perspectives from a focus group, responses to questions on the most and least effective aspects of online study and lasting impressions, and from reflective diaries kept by two of the authors while they were engaged in study from online courses. This direct evidence is used to highlight key issues in the literature from the viewpoint of the learner.",
        "Current interest in the use of Communications and Information Technology (C&amp;IT) in higher education and other settings is at a high level (for example, Framework V: Towards a User-Friendly Information Society; the ESRC Programme PACCIT) and while universities - in response to the Dearing Report - begin to exercise effort in restructuring course delivery methods to take advantage of the technology, there is a danger that the issue of the changes in the social dynamics that are a direct consequence of the transition from actual space to virtual space will be overlooked. Some work has been undertaken in this area (notably Rheingold, 1991; Cook, 1995; McConnell, Hardy and Hodgson, 1996) but there is need for additional research if we are to identify a clearer sense of how effective online learning might manifest itself.",
        "This book is written from the viewpoint that learning technology, although perceived of immense value, is not being exploited to its full potential, nor are its effects on student learning fully understood. Obtaining as accurate a picture as possible in order to correctly to influence policy and practice is an activity that is rightly receiving increased attention. No one could expect a &#x0027;how to do it&#x0027; book for this subject area.as outcomes (be they of learning, cost-effectiveness or of more abstract influence) are dictated by a wide range of factors. Martin Oliver (from the LaTTD group at the University of North London) has gathered a wide range of interesting papers (derived from the Evaluation of Learning Technologies conference, 1998) to demonstrate the diversity of approaches in this field. The book comprises some 242 pages that are arranged into 14 chapters, written by those involved in related projects.",
        "Enabling students to make effective use of study opportunities is an increasingly important element in consideration of university resource provision. Universities are expected to identify the added value which higher education represents, both to public funding bodies and to clients, whether students, parents or employers. Maximizing study potential can facilitate, as well as demonstrate, the added value which higher education offers. Quality assurance processes have also increased the focus on the climate and provision of support for study. And in a more robust climate of competition, provision of study-enhancing measures may be part of an institutional profile which will attract students of the best quality.",
        "We present a case to reposition theory so that it plays a pivotal role in learning technology research and helps to build an ecology of learning. To support the case, we present a critique of current practice based on a review of articles published in two leading international journals from 2005 to 2010. Our study reveals that theory features only incidentally or not at all in many cases. We propose theory development as a unifying theme for learning technology research study design and reporting. The use of learning design as a strategy to develop and test theories in practice is integral to our argument. We conclude by supporting other researchers who recommend educational design research as a theory focused methodology to move the field forward in productive and consistent ways. The challenge of changing common practice will be involved. However, the potential to raise the profile of learning technology research and improve educational outcomes justifies the effort required.",
        "This paper describes a three-year experiment to investigate the possibility of making economies by replacing practical laboratory sessions with courseware while attempting to ensure that the quality of the student learning experience did not suffer. Pathology labs are a central component of the first-year medical undergraduate curriculum at Southampton. Activities in these labs had been carefully designed and they were supervised by lab demonstrators who were subject domain experts. The labs were successful in the eyes of both staff and students but were expensive to conduct, in terms of equipment and staffing. Year by year evaluation of the introduction of courseware revealed that there was no measurable difference in student performance as a result of introducing the courseware, but that students were unhappy about the loss of interaction with the demonstrators. The final outcome of this experiment was a courseware replacement for six labs which included a software online hypertext adviser. The contribution of this work is that it adds to the body of empirical evidence in support of the importance of maintaining dialogue with students when introducing courseware, and it presents an example of how this interaction might be achieved in software.",
        "Although the notion of cognitive style has been around for some time, only in relatively recent times has there been a research interest in examining its effect on the performance of Computer-Assisted Learning (CAL) users. There are a number of practical difficulties associated with catering for different cognitive styles of CAL users. This paper identifies not only a style which influences CAL-user performance and overcomes many of the difficulties, but also a possible suitable measure of that style. Data on the reliability of this measure is reported, along with preliminary work on its use to cater for CAL users with different cognitive styles. Future work will focus on the development of the package and the predictive validity of the style measure.",

        "As networked learning becomes familiar at all levels and in all sectors of education, cross-fertilisation of innovative methods can usefully inform the lifelong learning agenda. Development of the pedagogical architectures and social processes, which afford learning, is a major challenge for educators as they strive to address the varied needs of a wide range of learners. One area in which this challenge is taken very seriously is that of trade unions, where recent large-scale projects have aimed to address many of these issues at a European level. This paper describes one such project, which targeted not only online courses, but also the wider political potential of virtual communities of practice. By analysing findings in relation to Wenger&#x0027;s learning architecture, the paper investigates further the relationships between communities of practice and communities of learners in the trade union context. The findings suggest that a focus on these relationships rather than on the technologies that support them should inform future developments.",
        "Recently, there have been major changes in the requirements of medical education which have set the scene for the revision of medical curricula (Towle, 1991; GMC, 1993). As part of the new curriculum at King's, the opportunity has been taken to integrate computer technology into the course through Computer-Assisted Learning (CAL), and to train graduates in core IT skills. Although the use of computers in the medical curriculum has up to now been limited, recent studies have shown encouraging steps forward (see Boelen, 1995). One area where there has been particular interest is the use of notebook computers to allow students increased access to IT facilities (Maulitz et al, 1996).",
        "This article presents the features, design and architecture of the Myst pervasive game platform that has been applied in creating pervasive mobile learning games in various contexts such as science festivals and museums in Finland. Based on our experiences with the development, we draw a set of design principles for creating successfully a pervasive game platform that can be easily ported to various contexts. These principles advocate openness, flexibility, interaction models, connections to the outside world, and participatory design of the game content. In the evaluation part we present preliminary results of tests conducted in Finland at the SciFest 2008 festival in Joensuu and at the Museum of Technology in Helsinki. The results suggest that games built with the Myst platform are particularly suitable for children and young adults, and these games motivate players to interact with the environment and help to learn by discovering new things. The Myst platform has clearly potential for similar success in other environments due to easy portability and extensibility.",
        "The development of technology in social-work education is set not only in the broader context of the use of technology in higher education generally, but also in the parallel context of the use of technology in social work practice. The latter is important for a subject area with two primary characteristics: the need to acquire not just academic knowledge but also professional expertise and understanding of the aims, methods and values of social work; a strong emphasis on practical preparation for work in social work agencies, which is expressed through the universal use of practice placements within agencies as a major component of social-work professional education and training.",
        "This paper outlines a problem we have found in our own practice when we have been developing new researchers at post-graduate level. When students begin research training and practice, they are often confused between different levels of thinking when they are faced with methods, methodologies and research paradigms. We argue that this confusion arises from the way research methods are taught, embedded and embodied in educational systems. We set out new ways of thinking about levels of research in the field of learning technology. We argue for a problem driven/pragmatic approach to research and consider the range of methods that can be applied as diverse lenses to particular research problems. The problem of developing a coherent approach to research and research methods is not confined to research in learning technology because it is arguably a problem for all educational research and one that also affects an even wider range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary subject areas. For the purposes of this paper we will discuss the problem in relation to research in learning technologies and make a distinction between developmental and basic research that we think is particularly relevant in this field. The paradigms of research adopted have real consequences for the ways research problems are conceived and articulated, and the ways in which research is conducted. This has become an even more pressing concern in the challenging funding climate that researchers now face. We argue that there is not a simple 1 to 1 relationship between levels and most particularly that there usually is not a direct association of particular methods with either a philosophical outlook or paradigm of research. We conclude by recommending a pluralist approach to thinking about research problems and we illustrate this with the suggestion that we should encourage researchers to think in terms of counterpositives. If the researcher suggests one way of doing research in an area, we suggest that they should then set out an opposing research approach from another perspective or paradigm. We link this conclusion to the provision of research training and the kinds of curricula that might be offered and we argue against the superficial and box ticking &#x2018;coverage&#x0027; of different standard research perspectives e.g. &#x2018;qualitative methods&#x0027; - &#x2018;qualitative methods&#x0027;.",
        "In any discipline, across a wide variety of subjects, there are numerous learning resources available to students. For many students the resources that will be most beneficial to them are quickly apparent but, because of the nature of philosophy and the philosophical method, it is not immediately clear which resources will be most valuable to students for whom the development of critical thinking skills is crucial. If we are to support these students effectively in their learning we must establish what these resources are how we can continue to maintain and improve them, and how we can encourage students to make good use of them. In this paper we describe and assess our evaluation of the use made by students of learning resources in the context of learning logic and in developing their critical thinking skills. We also assess the use of a new resource, electronic handsets, the purpose of which is to encourage students to respond to questions in lectures and to gain feedback about how they are progressing with the material.",
        "I am currently a member of a working party set up in my own university to look into a range of IT matters, including learning technology, with the aim of producing a mediumterm institutional plan. At many of the meetings I attend, I hear about the urgency of focusing our CAL effort, but the conviction around the table is often tempered by lecturers&#x0027; complaints that the off-the-shelf courseware they have tried either does not work well, or does not fit their particular needs, or both. So a suggestion is made: we should move in the direction of developing our own high-quality educational software tailored to our individual requirements. And since these requirements are very diverse over the whole campus, we should establish a Centre for Educational Technology, a Courseware Resources and Advice Unit, a Virtual Learning Development Laboratory, an Institute for Computer-Based Academic Practice . . . call it what you will. It should be staffed by experts who can advise departments and produce for them, or help them to produce, the exact software they require. It should be supported by a battalion of technicians, and should not only be equipped with white-hot multimedia but also backed by sufficient financial resources to ensure continuous upgrades so as to remain in a permanent state of state-of-the-art. The bank balance is not as healthy as it might be (whose is?), but the university management must nevertheless somehow be convinced of the necessity of spending money on the project.",
        "This retrospective study presents a comparison of assessment results achieved by distancelearning students and classroom-based students undertaking the same module in a degree course. The purpose of the comparison is to provide some objective measurement of the quality of distance education in relation to conventional classroom-based education. The authors have selected three groups of students, who have all undertaken the same module in the B. Sc Health Studies degree programme offered by the University of Paisley. One group (in Paisley) undertook their studies by means of conventional classroom-based education, the second (in Hong Kong) by supported distance learning with face-to-face contact in the form of tutorials, and the third (in a geographically dispersed group in the United Kingdom and other countries) by supported distance learning with no face-to-face contact. The results obtained by these three groups of students were analysed. Because of the differences in the size of the groups, the Kruskal- Wallis 1- Way Anova test was applied to validate the face value findings. The authors include findings from the literature comparing distance education with conventional education and from cross-cultural studies to present their data in context. Analysis of the assessment results showed that students from all three groups were successful in their studies, but the students studying by distance learning obtained significantly higher end-of-module results than their classroom-based colleagues. This latter finding reflects the conclusion that other investigators have reached In their discussion the authors identify educational, cultural and personal factors that may help to explain their findings. A limitation in the study is that it concerns only one module in the degree programme. The research now moves on to comparing students who have undertaken the whole degree programme by the means described",
        "The paper reports the theoretical underpinnings for the pedagogical role and rationale for adopting 3D virtual worlds for socialisation and knowledge creation in distance education. Socialisation or &#x2018;knowing one another&#x0027; in remote distributed environments can be achieved through synchronous technologies such as instant messaging, audio and video-conferencing. However, a 3D virtual world can provide an immersive experience where there is a visual presence and virtual proximity of the group members in terms of their 3D selves (avatars). We discuss the affordances of a 3D virtual world and its role in providing a platform for pedagogical design that engenders socialisation, synchronous communication and collaboration. We propose the use of a knowledge construction model as a framework for guiding the design of collaborative activities in a 3D virtual world for blended learning environments. We believe that this framework will also be useful for integrating 2D environments such as blogs, wikis and forums with a 3D learning environment. We consider the implications of this in the context of blended learning in distance education. This paper would be of interest to course designers, researchers, teachers, staff developers and policy-makers who are involved in integrating 3D virtual worlds within the curriculum of their programmes and institutions.",
        "The notion of convergence of disparate technologies has become popular with governments, computing and business sectors in the 1990s; but how has the convergence been implemented in the educational sector? One evident area of convergence in education has been the use of the Internet. But according to Gosper et al (1996), the most likely strategies for implementation are to use the Internet as a repository of reference, lecture materials and the presentation of the lectures. This could imply that the full potential of distributed learning through convergence might never be achieved. How can we implement good learning strategies following sound educational methodologies today, while not producing legacy systems or piecemeal content that could constrain future developments? In making it possible for distributed learning to occur, there are best-practice considerations applicable to most educational environments.",
        "Much of the literature theorising mobile learning emphasises the importance of context with physical and social contexts identified to date. Our work to design and implement authentic mobile simulation activities using SMS text messaging suggests that a third context may also be important. This is a virtual context, the learner-created cognitive space within which the activity takes place. The arrival of a message during a simulation activity will disrupt the real world physical and social contexts in which the learner finds themselves and transfer them into the virtual context. We argue that this disruptive power of the mobile device to shift the user&#x0027;s presence may be one of the distinguishing characteristics of certain mobile learning applications. This paper will explore the idea of the virtual context and discuss the role of issues of context, presence and disruption, illustrating these with reference to a case study of mobile simulation learning using SMS text messaging.",
        "In the context of academic induction courses, exploring conceptions of teaching and learning with new staff members confirms the notion that many academic staff want to teach as they have been taught. To encourage the adoption of new instructional strategies requires raising awareness of how students learn and supporting efforts to teach differently. Creative and flexible teaching requires an awareness of different methodologies, developing new skills with these methodologies and knowing when to apply these methods to optimize students&#x0027; learning. The process of managing teaching for effective learning is further complicated when staff are expected to use new technologies. Some staff members show an added level of reluctance to engage in constructive dialogue about changes in frameworks for learning and teaching when the potential of communications and information technology (C&amp;IT) is discussed.",

The implementation of the programme, which has so far involved over 400,000 teachers spread across the three countries since 2004, followed different models in the three countries, as a result of differing national education policies, systems and needs. Data from the external evaluation of the programme in Germany are used to examine the factors on a systemic level, which affected the implementation, effectiveness and sustainability of the programme. These factors are grouped into three categories: (1) concept transfer, (2) experience transfer and (3) establishing standards.",

        "Web-based lecture technologies (WBLT) have gained popularity amongst universities in Australia as a tool for delivering lecture recordings to students in close to real time. This paper reports on a selection of results from a larger research project investigating the impact of WBLT on teaching and learning. Results show that while staff see the advantages for external students, they question the extent to which these advantages apply to internal students. In contrast both cohorts of students were positive about the benefits of the technologies for their learning and they adopted similar strategies for their use. With the help of other technologies, some external students and staff even found WBLT useful for fostering communication between internal and external students. As such, while the traditional boundary between internal and external students seems to remain for some staff, students seem to find the boundary much less clear.",
        "Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are computer-based tools for the input, management, analysis, modelling and display of geographical data. GIS are applied in a wide range of organizations and disciplines, including central and local government, environmental agencies, transport planning and vehicle navigation, education and research, utilities management, resource management, and the financial and retail sectors. GIS is a field of constantly changing technology, and it has been recognized that GIS education needs to be more than a 'once in a lifetime' event (Muller, 1993). Consequently, GIS teachers have developed computer-based materials for learners at all levels, from school students to postgraduates, and for the independent professional updating their skills and knowledge. To date, these materials have followed a number of approaches. Initially demonstrations of GIS software and its capabilities addressed the need to increase awareness of GIS and its applications (DoE, 1987). Arcdemo (Green, 1987) was an innovative early example, providing a demonstration of the software package Arc/Info online. Training in particular software, and the need for hands-on experience, have been addressed with the production of software-specific educational materials which use primarily traditional text-based instructions for exercises with specially prepared data. Examples include Getting started in GIS (Langford, 1993), the Unitar workbooks for Idrisi (for example McKendry et al, 1992) and Understanding GIS: the Arc/Info Method (ESRI, 1990). These have proved particularly popular, and by directing learners through structured exercises allow new users to become familiar with complex software in a relatively short time. More recently, they have migrated to CD-ROM, with training materials such as Getting to know Arcview (ESRI, 1995) provided in this format, and combining software, data and demonstrations.",

        "The popularity of Facebook among university students inevitably raises questions on the educational potential of this Social Networking Site for Higher Education. From the limited literature on the instructional uses of Facebook, one can draw conflicting conclusions. Benefits were identified through the communicative potential, student participation in study groups and through informal learning, i.e. learning that takes place outside the formal structures of the learning environment. In contrast, it is also argued that the instructional benefits of Facebook are not straightforward. This phenomenographic investigation examines the perceptions of undergraduate Graphic Design students in a higher education institution in Cyprus, on the use of Facebook for teaching and learning. Characteristic of Art and Design education is the centrality of the studio and student self-reflection. Despite some literature that considers Facebook provides a viable alternative to the physical studio, the participants in this investigation expressed a preference for face-to-face instruction and consider Facebook as complimenting rather than replacing studio practices. Some participants benefited from the use of Facebook by joining support groups and exploring information relevant to their studies. Further research can investigate how Facebook can be embedded in studio-based teaching and learning.",
        "During the last five years, many changes have taken place in undergraduate Design education in the UK. The main force behind these changes has been the dramatic increase in the number of students without a commensurate increase in teaching staff. Typically, many Design departments are now teaching at student-staff ratios of up to 50:1 compared with the 10:1 typical of Design courses only a few years ago. With the more recent reductions in highereducation funding, combined with the added pressures on staff to raise their research profile and also become income generators, the problems relating to increased student numbers have been further exacerbated. The authors of this paper believe that in the current educational climate, the only way to maintain and promote the quality of the educational provision is to make teaching and learning more productive and efficient by harnessing modern technology.",
        "Online distance education (ODE) has become pervasive and can potentially transform pedagogical practices across primary, secondary and university-based educational systems. ODE is considered a flexible option for non-traditional students such as adult learners and home-schoolers, and a convenient way to deliver remedial courses. ODE is also a feasible and attractive option for rural schools, which educate 29% of all K&#x2013;12 students in the United States, and often struggle to provide advanced courses and attract highly qualified teachers. This paper presents qualitative data from both cohorts of a two-year, randomised, controlled research study of online distance learners in US rural high schools. Course providers in K&#x2013;12 environments often rely on the teacher-facilitator model, which assigns a local staff member in the role of on-site facilitator to operate equipment, distribute instructional materials, and answer questions. In order to address issues of isolation and interaction, and to attend to the local context, our study aimed to develop a learner-centred model of social support at the local, small-school level that emphasises communication and interaction. This expanded role links the local classroom environment more closely with the online environment. The responsibilities for ensuring student success are distributed between online instructor and facilitator: a form of hybrid learning.",

The paper presents a pedagogical perspective of mobile learning which highlights three central features of mobile learning: authenticity, collaboration and personalisation, embedded in the unique time-space contexts of mobile learning. A pedagogical framework was developed and tested through activities in two mobile learning projects located in teacher education communities: Mobagogy, a project in which faculty staff in an Australian university developed understanding of mobile learning; and The Bird in the Hand Project, which explored the use of smartphones by student teachers and their mentors in the United Kingdom. The framework is used to critique the pedagogy in a selection of reported mobile learning scenarios, enabling an assessment of mobile activities and pedagogical approaches, and consideration of their contributions to learning from a socio-cultural perspective.",

        "This paper reports on a case study into the contribution of podcasting to the curriculum transformation of two distance-taught master&#x0027;s programmes. Both programmes attract work-based Occupational Psychology practitioners, most of whom are in full-time employment. Challenges faced by the course team included adding flexibility to the curricula, increasing learner engagement (both with learning materials and feedback) and reducing learner isolation. As part of a coordinated enhancement effort, which included changes to curriculum design and delivery, 59 podcasts were introduced into the curriculum over a 12-month period. Qualitative and quantitative data were gathered from students and staff throughout the study. Action research ensured a regular flow of relevant evidence informing each stage of the renewal process. Evidence suggested that the students&#x0027; learning experiences improved as a result of four key benefits associated with the integration of podcasting in learning design: personalisation; an additional and different format for providing clear and engaging guidance, support and feedback; increased flexibility and mobility within the curricula; and &#x2018;design once, deliver many times&#x0027; with minimum adaptation.",
        "three sets of capacities are needed by the learner: strong motivation, self-management and reflection. Of the three, most educators readily understand the need for motivation (though how to help learners with this remains problematic) and many resources, approaches and techniques exist to help learners develop self-management. The third requirement, capacity to reflect, is much less understood. So a book with the title &#x0027;reflective learning in practice&#x0027; seems welcome.",
        "Scientific, experimental methodology was previously considered to be the only acceptable approach to educational research. Two important principles of experimental design are: &#x2022; to balance individual differences within study populations and so achieve generalizable results, and &#x2022; to attempt to isolate the effects of a single resource for evaluation purposes. Problems with this approach were reported in the literature of the 1970s (Elton and Laurillard, 1979; MacDonald and Jenkins, 1979) when the influence on learning of individual and contextual factors was recognized. Similar issues emerged during the 1980s and early 1990s, (Bates, 1981; Spencer, 1991) when the inability to identify which single or combined factors supported learning became a recurrent problem. It was clear that prior knowledge, approaches to learning, provision of appropriate scaffolding, complementary combinations of resources and various contextual factors all influenced the quality of learning outcomes. It was concluded that evaluations must be designed to account for these factors, rather than to balance or disregard them as was previously the norm (Kemmis, 1987, Gunn, 1995).",
        "The Association for Learning Technology celebrated its tenth anniversary this year and it can now be said that learning technology is a recognized research field, with a growing body of researchers and associated conferences and journals. Over the past two years as an editorial team we have undertaken a review of the position of ALT-J in relation to other journals in the area and considered the nature and scope of the papers we publish.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank all the referees for their involvement and commitment to the journal and for their continued work on refereeing papers. As part of the review process we will be moving to a new publisher, Taylor and Francis, commencing with Volume 12; this is, in part, driven by a desire to increase our international profile and readership, as well as seeking to have a better online presence including electronic access to all papers. We are, after all, a research journal on learning technologies!

        "Video-linked lectures allow healthcare students across multiple sites, and between university and hospital bases, to come together for the purposes of shared teaching. Recording and streaming video-linked lectures allows students to view them at a later date and provides an additional resource to support student learning. As part of a UK Higher Education Academy-funded Pathfinder project, this study explored medical students&#x0027; perceptions of video-linked lectures and video-streaming, and their impact on learning. The methodology involved semi-structured interviews with 20 undergraduate medical students across four sites and five year groups. Several key themes emerged from the analysis. Students generally preferred live lectures at the home site and saw interaction between sites as a major challenge. Students reported that their attendance at live lectures was not affected by the availability of streamed lectures and tended to be influenced more by the topic and speaker than the technical arrangements. These findings will inform other educators interested in employing similar video technologies in their teaching.Keywords: video-linked lecture; video-streaming; student perceptions; decisionmaking; cross-campus teaching.",
        "The purpose of this study is to analyse what is happening at schools regarding the integration and use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and to examine teachers&#x0027; perceptions about what teaching and learning processes can be improved through the use of ICT. A multiple-case-study research methodology was applied. From a previous exploratory research, four different types of schools were determined. Data show there is a widespread view that ICT in teaching favours several teaching and learning processes. In particular, it shows that the contribution of ICT to the improvement of teaching and learning processes is higher in the schools that have integrated ICT as an innovation factor. To attain this highest level implies that a school not only has to modernise the technological tools, but also has to change the teaching models: the teacher&#x0027;s role, issues regarding classroom organisational, the teaching and learning processes, and the interaction mechanisms.",
        "The public universities in Hong Kong are preparing for a momentous educational reform in the Fall of 2012 that will create four- instead of three-year degrees and add a strong General Education component to the curriculum. In this essay, I examine the trajectory of this reform from the point of view of an \"insider-outsider\" Fulbright Scholar in General Education who, based at the University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong America Center (but working with colleagues across the system), consulted on the formation of interdisciplinary courses, interactive teaching, and administrative infrastructure for the launch of the reform. I examine the change in light of the flow of global capital, the development of the \"whole person\" familiar to us from the discourse of the Liberal Arts, and of the demands of multinationals based in Hong Kong for a differently trained globalized workforce. The Hong Kong experiment is, I argue, an illuminating site to examine in order for us to better understand the emergence of the global university.",
        "One of the essential components of the early modern European response to China was an emphasis on the fabulous wealth and social organization of Chinese society. Despite their knowledge of the wide-scale abandonment and killing of newborns within the society, and despite the categorization of infanticide as a great moral sin by the early Christian church, the European travelers to China commented on infanticide dispassionately, without any moral revulsion, and continued to project an image of China as a virtual utopia for its residents. One reason for the detached descriptions of abandonment of children and infanticide in China might be the fact that conditions with regard to children in Europe were no superior to those in China and were probably far worse; the vast numbers of abandoned and dead children in Europe blunted the edge of criticism with regard to Chinese customs. Another might be that infanticide was practiced within Europe contemporaneously, even though the killing of newborn children there was practiced much more surreptitiously, and public opinion had firmed up connections among single women, illegitimacy, concealment, and murder. However, the dire social circumstances within their own countries had not prevented the Europeans from soundly criticizing and morally reproving cannibalism or infanticide in other cultures. In order to understand their acceptance of this “sinful” practice in China, we must look elsewhere.",
        "From his first film—a twenty-minute short, “Expectations” (1982)—to his last—a three-hour masterpiece, 'Yi Yi' (2000)—Edward Yang, one of the leading figures of the Taiwan New Cinema movement, devoted his career to portraying the impact of neoliberal capitalism on the lives of the citizens of Taipei. Interestingly, Yang’s films often employ female perspectives to criticize Taiwan’s education system and transnational corporations for perpetuating neoliberal capitalism’s ideology of self-fulfillment and upward mobility. This paper draws upon feminist film theory to investigate the ways in which Yang’s third feature, 'The Terrorizers' (1986), utilizes various innovative cinematic languages to engender a multitude of women’s perspectives to expose male voyeurism and ultimately criticize the impact of neoliberal capitalism in Taipei.",

Xi Jinping’s administration has continued these efforts, attempting to achieve a world-class education system by 2020. This paper will examine the accomplishments of the Chinese education system in the post-Mao era, and discuss the gap between the current status of Chinese education and the requirements of a world-class education, ultimately arguing that there is still a big gap between a Chinese education and the most advantaged education systems in the world. To establish a globalized educational system, build world-class universities, and train internationally recognized Chinese scholars, this paper suggests that it is necessary for China to scrutinize and reshape its educational philosophy, since a philosophy of education is the guiding principle for any country to achieve the goal of providing its citizens with a world-class education.",
        "The symbolic ordination of trees as monks in Thailand is widely perceived in Western scholarship to be proof of the power of Buddhism to spur ecological thought. However, a closer analysis of tree ordination demonstrates that it is not primarily about Buddhist teaching, but rather is an invented tradition based on the sanctity of Thai Buddhist symbols as well as those of spirit worship and the monarchy. Tree ordinations performed by non-Buddhist minorities in Thailand do not demonstrate a religious commitment but rather a political one.",
        "While China’s environmental problems have been well publicized to a global audience, its citizens’ environmental activism is lesser known.  This paper assesses the major environmental activism that Chinese environmental Non-Government Organizations and Chinese citizens have engaged in since the mid-nineties to date, focusing, in particular, on the unique nature of such activism in an authoritarian context.  I argue that environmental activism in China has garnered legitimacy and provided citizens with opportunities to become agents of social change.  Chinese citizens have become adept at taking advantage of the state’s wish to enforce environmental regulations at the local level, adept at developing alliances with Chinese officials as well as with, in some cases, transnational actors, and adept at using communicative technology to demonstrate and to organize their environmental discontent.  Chinese environmental activism has also helped environmentally affected victims to learn of, and to exercise, their rights as citizens.<strong></strong>",

        "We present two examples of technology transfer from analogical to digital systems, in two works of live electroacoustic music by the Portuguese composer Jorge Peixinho (1940-1995), Harmónicos (1967) and Sax-Blue (1982). These works require the use of analogue technology that has become obsolete or difficult to access by the average performer. We think that migration from electronics to software, also referred as recast represents a necessary step to preserve live electroacoustic music. However, this process can pose multiple questions as it also relies on aesthetic considerations. In this case, we put on a considerable effort into understanding both the composer's intentions and the equipment operating mode and we think the solutions proposed are adequate to perform both works. Finally, we discuss some of the questions, solutions and limitations that arose with these recasts and how they can contribute to the sustainability problem concerning these works.",

        "<p>This article summarises our Ph.D. thesis – an analytical view on the player-game relationship through the lens of an action-oriented framework, centred on fundamental entities defined as actors, entities through which action is enacted in the game and of which the player and the game system are a part of. With this in mind, the grounding principles of this framework are seeded in a transition of action into experience, based on communicational systems that structure the dynamic formation of networks of actors from which distinct behaviours emerge, which, in turn, promote the enactment of diverse sequences of events establishing narrative, which is a source of experience of the player. Chronology, responsiveness, thinking and actuation, transcoding, focus, depth, and traversal are the 7 dimensions we unveiled through the lens of this action-oriented framework. This work proposes that video games can be regarded as action-based artefacts and a call to awareness for game designers that when designing for action they are working with the foundations on which video games are built upon.</p><p> </p>",

The representations, all carrying the mark of their own time, not only tell a story about the late Qing Chinese predicament and dilemma of its modernization, but also reveal the trajectory of the changing ideologies behind their own production. In this sense, the films can be read as both historical and contemporary texts. This article attempts to trace the changing representation by comparing and analyzing major historical films of China from the 1950s to the 1990s, and focuses the discussion on several main themes.",

The West writes of Tibet as an exotic solution to its own malaise, or as the last refuge of Hermetic wisdom. The Han Chinese have used Tibet as a muse and as an antidote to materialism. The current literary criticism brushes over cultural and stylistic concerns to cut right to politics. In every case, Tibet as a cultural concept is simply used to complement something external to it, to stand in contrast to something else. The Tibetan writer Alai specifically rejects these negative and meaningless definitions of Tibet.",

This is especially the case with ancient Greek philosophy understood as the foundation of the Western philosophical tradition. Unreflective application to ancient Greek thought of methodologies that developed later in the tradition can introduce ways of thinking as foreign to it as to a non-Western tradition.

        "<p>Attempts to describe aesthetic artefacts through informational models have existed at least since the late 1950s; but they have not been as successful as their proponents expected nor are they popular among art scholars because of their (mostly) quantitative nature. However, given how information technology has deeply shifted every aspect of our world, it is fair to ask whether aesthetic value continues to be immune to informational interpretations. This paper discusses the ideas of the late Russian biophysicist, Mikhail Volkenstein concerning art and aesthetic value. It contrasts them with Max Bense’s ‘information aesthetics’, and with contemporary philosophical understandings of information. Overall, this paper shows that an informational but not necessarily quantitative approach serves not only as an effective means to describe our interaction with artworks, but also contributes to explain why purely quantitative models struggle to formalise aesthetic value. Finally, it makes the case that adopting an informational outlook helps overcome the ‘analogue vs digital’ dichotomy by arguing the distinction is epistemological rather than ontological, and therefore the two notions need not be incompatible.</p>",

Due to her close attention to female psychology in a patriarchal society, Kirino is often considered as a feminist writer. J. Madison Davis comments on Kirino’s rich imagination in 'Out 'in an article published in a recent issue of 'World Literature Today', in which he points out that her fiction creates not only fascinating plots but also a rare sense of reality, especially reality that women face in contemporary Japan. 'Out 'centers on a murder-mystery case, which involves a housewife killing her abusive husband with the help of three female coworkers from a 'bento'-box factory. Behind the murder mystery there is a shocking depiction of reality—although Japan is among the most industrialized nations in the world, women still suffer social and economic inequality and violence within the family.",

        "Global competition and increased environmental concern have emphasized the significance of process quality for an economic success. Statistical Process Control (SPC) is considered as one of the major tools for better quality. However, there are many opinions about the nature, the role and the results of SPC in industry. If SPC is understood and implemented correctly, then it should not only lead to \"a reduction of waste, shorter throughput times and greater reliability of supply, but also in a better understanding of the processes and their variation\" as Does, Roes and Trip formulated it. SPC should ultimately lead to \"an operational management of the continuous improvement of processes.\" The aim of an industrial production process is to make profit, thus quality should be measured by process profitability. From a more operational point of view highest quality, i.e. highest profitability, is reached by producing with high conformance to an appropriately selected target value, and quality improvement means further reduction of variation around the target value. Thus, understanding the inherent variation represents the key for controlling \"profitability\" and for being able to implement a system of continuous \"quality improvement\". The inherent variations reflect the complex relations between everything concerning the production process and results in uncertainty about the future development. Exactly at this point stochastics, the science of uncertainty, enters the stage. For controlling profitability the relations and the resulting variations have to be taken appropriately into account by an integrated and objective-oriented stochastic approach.",

        "Delegating the sovereignty from the citizens to the Government is necessary, to a certain degree, in order to ensure the efficiency of the constitution and the separation of powers, as well as the process of lawmaking.

Thus the decision tends to become more distant from the citizens, than it was in the Greek democracy for example. The new means of communication, especially the Internet, give the citizen the possibility to be closer to the decisions taken by the legislator.

        "All-solid-state lithium-ion batteries using Li+-ion conducting ceramic electrolytes have been focused on as attractive future batteries for electric vehicles and renewable energy conversion systems because high safety can be realized due to non-flammability of ceramic electrolytes. In addition, a higher volumetric energy density than that of current lithium-ion batteries is expected since the all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries can be made in bipolar cell configurations. However, the special ideas and techniques based on ceramic processing are required to construct the electrochemical interface for all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries since the battery development has been done so far based on liquid electrolyte system over 100 years. As one of promising approaches to develop practical all-solid-state batteries, we have been focusing on three-dimensionally (3D) structured cell configurations such as an interdigitated combination of 3D pillars of cathode and anode, which can be realized by using solid electrolyte membranes with hole-array structures. The application of such kinds of 3D structures effectively increases the interface between solid electrode and solid electrolyte per unit volume, lowering the internal resistance of all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries. In this study, Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 (LLZAl), which is a Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZ) with Li+-ion conductivity of ~10–4 S cm–1 at room temperature and high stability against lithium-metal, was used as a solid electrolyte, and its pellets with 700 um depth holes in 700 x 700 um2 area were fabricated to construct 3D-structured all-solid-state batteries with LiCoO2 / LLZAl / lithium-metal configuration. It is expected that the LiCoO2-LLZAl interface is formed by point to point contact even when the LLZAl pellet with 3D hole-array structure is applied. Therefore, the application of mechanically soft Li3BO3 with a low melting point at around 700 °C was also performed as a supporting Li+-ion conductor to improve the LiCoO2-LLZAl interface.",

The article will conclude with a summary of recent research efforts in this field as well as the future prospects for the use of nitrogen-doped carbon materials in Li-S batteries.",
        "Developed in the early 1900's, the Haber-Bosch synthesis is the dominant NH3 synthesis process.  Parallel to catalyst optimization, current research efforts are also focused on the investigation of new methods for ammonia synthesis, including the electrochemical synthesis with the use of solid electrolyte cells.  Since the first report on Solid State Ammonia Synthesis (SSAS), more than 30 solid electrolyte materials were tested and at least 15 catalysts were used as working electrodes. Thus far, the highest rate of ammonia formation reported is 1.13×10−8 mol s−1 cm−2, obtained at 80°C with a Nafion solid electrolyte and a mixed oxide, SmFe0.7Cu0.1Ni0.2O3, cathode. At high temperatures (>500oC) the maximum rate was 9.5*10-9 mol s−1 cm−2 using Ce0.8Y0.2O2-δ -[Ca3(PO4)2 -K3PO4] as electrolyte and Ag-Pd as cathode. In this paper, the advantages and the disadvantages of SSAS vs the conventional process and the requirements that must be met in order to promote the electrochemical process into an industrial level, are discussed.",
        "Abstract. With the transition from modernism to postmodernism, identity as a concept has started to become redefined in sociology literature. The aim of this study is to show that postmodernism and symbolic interactionism are fused together to delineate both the scene as well as an actor’s identity. In that way, the interaction of a social structure with a culture that won’t be completely ignored, and, with the opinion that the categorized roles can skillfully be shaped and diversified by actors, it is possible to refrain from a pure determinism. But the transformation to enter different roles lacks meaning. Individuals pay more attention to their appearance more than who they are in order to be accepted by each group. In this manner, a metaphysical shell game begins. In the following study, the “Social Appearance Anxiety” was used as an indicator of this game.  And to determine who is willing to play the game, cultural parameters were utilized. \n      This study was based on the analysis of the data collected through two questionnaires given to 181 students studying at Hitit University. The INDCOL questionnaire [Singelis et al., 1995] measuring cultural values and “Social Appearance Anxiety” scale developed by [Hart, 2008] were used in the study.",
        "This article examines the “aesthetic” and “prescient” turn in the surveillant assemblage and the various ways in which risk technologies in local law enforcement are reshaping the post hoc traditions of the criminal justice system. The rise of predictive policing and crime prevention software illustrate not only how the world of risk management solutions for public security is shifting from sovereign borders to inner-city streets but also how the practices of authorization are allowing software systems to become proxy forms of sovereign power. The article also examines how corporate strategies and law enforcement initiatives align themselves through media, connectivity, and consumer-oriented opt-in strategies that endeavor to “mold” and “deputize” ordinary individuals into obedient and patriotic citizens.",
        "A limited research and development budget usually implies that decisions must be made regarding the distribution of the available funds among the most promising R & D projects. The MARKAL model is used to describe a national energy system where existing and new energy conversion and process technologies compete for a market share in satisfying exogenously specified demand patterns. A measure is introduced which may be used to rank the relative importance of a technology in the energy system. Several scenarios depicting different restrictions on the energy system are used in the analysis.",
        "The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a well-researched problem in the Operations Research literature. It is the view of the authors of this paper that the various VRP variants have been researched in isolation. This paper embodies an attempt to integrate three specific variants of the VRP, namely the VRP with multiple time windows, the VRP with a heterogeneous fleet, and the VRP with double scheduling, into an initial solution algorithm. The proposed initial solution algorithm proves feasible for the integration, while the newly introduced concept of time window compatibility decreases the computational burden when using benchmark data sets from literature as a basis for efficiency testing. The algorithm also improves the quality of the initial solution for a number of problem classes.",
        "In this article, we survey the developments in the generalised models of repairable systems reliability during 1990s, particularly the last five years. In this field, we notice the sharp fundamental problem that voluminous complex models were developed but there is an absence of sufficient data of interest for justifying the success in tackling the real engineering problems. Instead of following the myth of using simple models to face the complex reality, we select and review some practical models, particularly the stochastic processes behind them. The Models in three quick growth areas: age models, condition monitoring technique related models, say, proportional intensity and their extensions, and shock and wearing models, including the delay-time models are reviewed. With the belief that only those stochastic processes reflecting the instinct nature of the actual physical processes of repairable systems, without excessive assumptions, may have a better chance to meet the demands of engineers and managers.",

The essential part of the article presents the partial results of the research, which was directed to consumers buying bio-products in Slovakia.",
        "With an estimated one billion smartphones producing over 5 petabytes of data a day, the spatially aware mobile device has become a near ubiquitous presence in daily life. Cogent, excellent research in a variety of fields has explored what the spatial data these devices produce can reveal of society, such as analysis of Foursquare check-ins to reveal patterns of mobility for groups through a city. In such studies, the individual intentions, motivations, and desires behind the production of said data can become lost through computational aggregation and analysis. In this commentary, I argue for a rethinking of the epistemological leap from individual to data point through a (re)seating of the reflexive, self-eliciting subject as an object for spatial big data research. To do so, I first situate current research on spatial big data within a computational turn in social sciences that relies overly on the data produced as a stand-in for the subject producing said data. Second, I argue that a recent shift within geography and cognate disciplines toward viewing spatial big data as a form of spatial media allows for study of the sociotechnical processes that produce modern assemblages of data and society. As spatial media, the spatial big data created through mobile device use can be understood as the data of everyday life and as part of the sociotechnical processes that produce individuals, data, and space. Ultimately, to understand the data of everyday life, researchers must write thick descriptions of the stories we tell ourselves about the data we give off to others.",
        "Sharing social media research datasets allows for reproducibility and peer-review, but it is very often difficult or even impossible to achieve due to legal restrictions and can also be ethically questionable. What is more, research data repositories and other research infrastructure and research support institutions are only starting to target social media researchers. In this paper, we present a practical solution to sharing social media data with the help of a social science data archive. Our aim is to contribute to the effort of enhancing comparability and reproducibility in social media research by taking some first steps towards setting standards for sustainable data archiving. We present a showcase for sharing social media data with the example of a big dataset containing geotagged tweets (several months of continued geotagged tweets from the United States from 2014 and 2015; nearly half a billion tweets in total) through a research data archive. We provide a general background to the process of long-term archiving of research data. After some consideration of the current obstacles for sharing and archiving social media data, we present our solution of archiving the specific dataset of geotagged tweets at the GESIS Data Archive for the Social Sciences, a publicly funded German data archive for secure and long-term archiving of social science data. We archived and documented tweet IDs and additional information to improve reproducibility of the initial research while also attending to ethical and legal considerations, and taking into account Twitter’s terms of service in particular.",
        "Most cellulolytic enzyme blends, either procured from a commercial vendor or isolated from a single cellulolytic microbial secretome, do not efficiently hydrolyze ammonia-pretreated (e.g., ammonia fiber expansion, AFEX) lignocellulosic agricultural crop residues like corn stover to fermentable sugars. Typically reported commercial enzyme loading (30–100 mg protein/g glucan) necessary to achieve &gt;90% total hydrolysis yield (to monosaccharides) for AFEX-treated biomass, within a short saccharification time frame (24–48 h), is economically unviable. Unlike acid-based pretreatments, AFEX retains most of the hemicelluloses in the biomass and therefore requires a more complex suite of enzymes for efficient hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose at industrially relevant high solids loadings. One strategy to reduce enzyme dosage while improving cocktail effectiveness for AFEX-treated biomass has been to use individually purified enzymes to determine optimal enzyme combinations to maximize hydrolysis yields. However, this approach is limited by the selection of heterologous enzymes available or the labor required for isolating low-abundance enzymes directly from the microbial secretomes. Here, we show that directly blending crude cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes-rich microbial secretomes can maximize specific activity on AFEX-treated biomass without having to isolate individual enzymes. Fourteen commercially available cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes were procured from leading enzyme companies (Novozymes®, Genencor®, and Biocatalysts®) and were mixed together to generate several hundred unique cocktail combinations. The mixtures were assayed for activity on AFEX-treated corn stover (AFEX-CS) using a previously established high-throughput methodology. The optimal enzyme blend combinations identified from these screening assays were enriched in various low-abundance hemicellulases and accessory enzymes typically absent in most commercial cellulases cocktails. Our simple approach of blending crude commercially available enzyme cocktails allowed a drastic fourfold reduction in total enzyme requirements (from 30 to 7.5 mg enzyme/g glucan loading) to achieve near-theoretical cellulose and hemicellulose saccharification yields for AFEX-CS.",
        "Process intensification (PI) technologies represent all approaches leading to size reduction and efficiency improvement of process equipment. Thermal energy storage (TES) systems are key elements in renewable and recovery thermal energy deployments, and their performance can benefit from PI principles. This study covers a brief analysis and state of the art of several PI technologies applied to TES systems. All sensible, latent, and thermochemical storage systems are covered. Two surface-to-volume ratios closely related to component size and system performance are first analyzed. They theoretically show how PI principles may inspire the performance enhancement of TES systems. Then, a brief synthesis on successful PI applications in sensible, latent, and thermochemical storages is given. Their approaches mainly consist of thermal stratification preservation, modular design, heat and mass transfer enhancement, as well as material properties modification. Finally, potential TES system improvement directions based on PI principles are recommended.",
        "The requirement for a miniature, high density, long life, rechargeable power source is common to a vast majority of microsystems, including the implantable devices for medical applications. A model biofuel cell system operating in human serum has been studied for future applications of biomedical and implantable medical devices. Anodic and cathodic electrodes were made of carbon nanotube –buckypaper modified with PQQ-dependent glucose dehydrogenase and laccase, respectively. Modified electrodes were characterized electrochemically and assembled in a biofuel cell set-up. Power density of 16.12 μW/cm2 was achieved in human serum for lower than physiological glucose concentrations. Increasing the glucose concentration and biofuel cell temperature caused an increase on power output leading up to 49.16 μW/cm2.",
        "This paper discusses how an interactive artwork, the Crowd-Sourced Intelligence Agency (CSIA), can contribute to discussions of Big Data intelligence analytics. The CSIA is a publicly accessible Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) system that was constructed using information gathered from technical manuals, research reports, academic papers, leaked documents, and Freedom of Information Act files. Using a visceral heuristic, the CSIA demonstrates how the statistical correlations made by automated classification systems are different from human judgment and can produce false-positives, as well as how the display of information through an interface can affect the judgment of an intelligence agent. The public has the right to ask questions about how a computer program determines if they are a threat to national security and to question the practicality of using statistical pattern recognition algorithms in place of human judgment. Currently, the public’s lack of access to both Big Data and the actual datasets intelligence agencies use to train their classification algorithms keeps the possibility of performing effective sous-dataveillance out of reach. Without this data, the results returned by the CSIA will not be identical to those of intelligence agencies. Because we have replicated how OSINT is processed, however, our results will resemble the type of results and mistakes made by OSINT systems. The CSIA takes some initial steps toward contributing to an informed public debate about large-scale monitoring of open source, social media data and provides a prototype for counterveillance and sousveillance tools for citizens.",
        "Biodiesel is a renewable, clean, alternative energy source with advantages such as excellent lubricity, superior biodegradability and high combustion efficiency. Biodiesel is considered for mixing with fishing boat fuels to adjust their fuel characteristics so that toxic pollutants and greenhouse-effect gas emissions from such shipping might be reduced. The effects of blending fishing boat fuels A and B with various weight proportions of biodiesel are experimentally investigated in this study. The results show that biodiesel blending can significantly improve the inferior fuel properties of both fishing boat fuels and particularly fuel B. The flash points of both of these fuels increases significantly with the addition of biodiesel and thus enhances the safety of transporting and storing these blended fuels. The flash point of fishing boat fuel B even increases by 16% with 25 wt% biodiesel blending. The blending of biodiesel with no sulfur content is found to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the high sulfur content of fishing boat fuel, resulting in a reduction in the emission of sulfur oxides. The addition of only 25 wt% biodiesel decreased the sulfur content of the fishing boat fuel by 37%. The high kinematic viscosity of fishing boat fuel B was also observed to be reduced by 63% with the blending of just 25 wt% biodiesel. However, biodiesel blending caused a slight decrease in heating value around 1% to 4.5%.",
        "Microalgal biofuels are currently considered to be the most promising alternative to future renewable energy source. Microalgae have great potential to produce various biofuels, including biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane, and biohydrogen. Cultivation of biofuel-producing microalgae demands favorable environmental conditions, such as suitable light, temperature, nutrients, salinity, and pH. However, these conditions are not always compatible with the conditions beneficial to biofuel production, because biofuel-related compounds (such as lipids and carbohydrates) tend to accumulate under environmental-stress conditions of light, temperature, nutrient, and salt. This paper presents a brief overview of the effects of environmental conditions on production of microalgal biomass and biofuel, with specific emphasis on how to utilize environmental stresses to improve biofuel productivity. The potential avenues of reaping the benefits of enhanced biofuel production by environmental stresses while maintaining high yields of biomass production have been discussed.",
        "This paper discusses the empirical, Application Programming Interface (API)-based analysis of very large Facebook Pages. Looking in detail at the technical characteristics, conventions, and peculiarities of Facebook’s architecture and data interface, we argue that such technical fieldwork is essential to data-driven research, both as a crucial form of data critique and as a way to identify analytical opportunities. Using the “We are all Khaled Said” Facebook Page, which hosted the activities of nearly 1.9 million users during the Egyptian Revolution and beyond, as empirical example, we show how Facebook’s API raises important questions about data detail, completeness, consistency over time, and architectural complexity. We then outline an exploratory approach and a number of analytical techniques that take the API and its idiosyncrasies as a starting point for the concrete investigation of a large dataset. Our goal is to close the gap between Big Data research and research about Big Data by showing that the critical investigation of technicity is essential for empirical research and that attention to the particularities of empirical work can provide a deeper understanding of the various issues Big Data research is entangled with.",
        "In this paper two mathematical programming models, both with multiple objective functions, are proposed to solve four related categories of job scheduling problems. All four of these categories have the property that the duration of the jobs is dependent on the time of implementation and in some cases the preceding job. Furthermore, some jobs (restricted to subsets of the total pool of jobs) can, to different extents, run in parallel. In addition, not all the jobs need necessarily be implemented during the given time period.",
        "Accurate prediction of daily peak load demand is very important for decision makers in the energy sector. This helps in the determination of consistent and reliable supply schedules during peak periods. Accurate short term load forecasts enable effective load shifting between transmission substations, scheduling of startup times of peak stations, load flow analysis and power system security studies. A multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) modelling approach towards daily peak electricity load forecasting in South Africa is presented in this paper for the period 2000 to 2009. MARS is a non-parametric multivariate regression method which is used in high-dimensional problems with complex model structures, such as nonlinearities, interactions and missing data, in a straight forward manner and produces results which may easily be explained to management. The models developed in this paper consist of components that represent calendar and meteorological data. The performances of the models are evaluated by comparing them to a piecewise linear regression model. The results from the study show that the MARS models achieve better forecast accuracy.",

        "Lithium superionic conductors with the Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS)-type structure are promising materials for use as solid electrolytes in next-generation lithium batteries. A novel member of the LGPS family, Li9.42Si1.02P2.1S9.96O2.04, and its solid solutions were synthesised by quenching from 1273 K in the Li2S–P2S5–SiO2 pseudoternary system. The material exhibited an ionic conductivity as high as 3.2×10−4 S cm−1 at 298 K, as well as the high electrochemical stability to lithium metal, which was improved by the introduction of oxygen into the LGPS-type structure. An all-solid-state cell with a lithium metal anode and Li9.42Si1.02P2.1S9.96O2.04 as the separator showed excellent performance with a high coulomb efficiency of 100%. Thus, oxygen doping is an effective way of improving the electrochemical stability of LGPS-type structure.",
        "Three large high radioactivity particulate fragments, each several 100 μm in diameter, have been recovered from the region immediately surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Through the application of high-resolution electron and ion-beam methods, this work has sought to investigate the structure and composition of this fibrous surface morphology. By evaluating this, a potential material source can be determined, alongside important information relating to the conditions/events at the time of the reactor explosions and catastrophic release of radioactive materials. The results of this study show that the fibrous features associated with these large radiocesium-containing particles share a common elemental composition. With respect to the surrounding particle, the fibers are enriched in Si, Cl, and Fe, while depleted in both Zn and Al. Based on composition, these fibers are ascribed to thermal insulating material used within the plant, which was sufficiently heated during the loss of coolant incident at the plant to be incorporated into the molten ejecta material that rapidly solidified upon quenching in air. Elemental analysis of these fibers does not reveal any evidence of leaching or the presence of actinide materials.",
        "Most current supply chain models were developed during a period of relative stability. Today, the environment is discontinuous, volatile and unpredictable. This requires a major rethinking and revitalisation of existing supply chain models. Supply chains are much more than warehouses, transportation and technology, they are people powered and have to be treated as social and political as well as economic and technical systems.<br /><br />The most difficult yet challenging and rewarding factor is the change of mindset from approaches based on the old industrial paradigm to the new knowledge oriented paradigm. From \"one size fits all\" to customisation and buyer behaviour oriented segmentation based on structural flexibility. The new approach requires a change of processes and management systems, but most of all, a change of mindset, organisation structure and behaviour.<br /><br />This may create internal resistance that has to be overcome to reach the desired future state. This future state is highly dependent on cooperation and consensus with external companies, and the next step is therefore to extend the alignment approach to the chosen partners in the demand chain. The development towards channel rather than company competition requires an interorganisational approach to channel design. Internal alignment and cooperation is necessary but not sufficient, which means that an agile and dynamically aligned demand chain has to be created.<br /><br />All this is well known and documented in both research and theory. However, the challenge is to implement these theories, models and behaviour in practice. This paper presents one practical approach to implementation of the theories put forth by Ericsson [Ericsson D, 2011, Demand chain management - The evolution, ORiON, 27(1), pp. 45-81.].",
        "During the last decade visual interactive simulation has become established as a useful new tool for solving real life problems. It offers the Operational Research professional the opportunity to impact beneficially on important new decision making areas of business and industry. As an example, this paper discusses its application to the scheduling of production on batch chemical plants, which to date has remained largely a manual activity. Two different approaches are introduced, and it is concluded that while discrete event simulation is most useful as an aid to learning at a time of change, bar chart simulation is preferred for the day to day scheduling. The technique has been implemented on a number of plants and has led to significant improvements in their performance. Some areas for further development are identified.",
        "Heterosigma akashiwo is an excellent candidate for growth on industrial emissions, since this alga has the ability to metabolize gaseous nitric oxide (NO) into cellular nitrogen via a novel chimeric protein (NR2-2/2HbN) and also tolerates wide fluctuations in temperature, salinity, and nutrient conditions. Here, we evaluated biomass productivity and composition, photosynthetic efficiency, and expression of NR2-2/2HbN for Heterosigma growing on simulated flue gas containing 12% CO2 and 150 ppm NO. Biomass productivity of Heterosigma more than doubled in flue gas conditions compared to controls, reflecting a 13-fold increase in carbohydrate and a 2-fold increase in protein productivity. Lipid productivity was not affected by flue gas and the valuable omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA, constituted up to 16 % of total FAMEs. Photochemical measurements indicated that photosynthesis in Heterosigma is not inhibited by high CO2 and NO concentrations, and increases in individual fatty acids in response to flue gas were driven by photosynthetic requirements. Growth rates and maximum cell densities of Heterosigma grown on simulated flue gas without supplemental nitrogen, along with a significant increase in NR2-2/2HbN transcript abundance in response to flue gas, demonstrated that nitrogen derived from NO gas is biologically available to support enhanced CO2 fixation. Together, these results illustrate the robustness of this alga for commercial-scale biomass production and bioremediation of industrial emissions.",
        "Chemisorbed water and solvent molecules and their reactivity with components from the electrolyte in high-surface nanostructured electrodes remains a contributing factor towards capacity diminishment on cycling in lithium ion batteries due to the limit in maximum annealing temperature. Here we report a marked improvement in the capacity retention of amorphous TiO2 by the choice of preparation solvent, control of annealing temperature and the presence of surface functional groups. Careful heating of the amorphous TiO2 sample prepared in acetone under vacuum lead to complete removal of all molecular solvent and an improved capacity retention of 220 mAh/g over 50 cycles at a C/10 rate. Amorphous TiO2 when prepared in ethanol and heated under vacuum showed an even better capacity retention of 240 mAh/g. From FTIR Spectroscopy and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy measurements, the improved capacity is attributed to the complete removal of ethanol and the presence of very small fractions of residual functional groups coordinated to oxygen-deficient surface titanium sites. These displace the more reactive chemisorbed hydroxyl groups, limiting reaction with components from the electrolyte and possibly enhancing the integrity of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI). The present research provides a facile strategy to improve the capacity retention of nanostructured electrode materials.",
        "Electrochemical capacitor is the most promising energy storage device that can meet the demands of high power supply and long cycle life, however low energy density and high fabrication cost limit its further development. Researchers have paid more attention to the development of electrode material in the past, and very few people attach importance to the research of the electrolyte, especially the redox electrolyte, which is important for improving specific capacitance greatly.

The method is also extended to non-linear objective functions by allowing for line searches within the interior and along bounding hypersurfaces. A formal unified algorithm is presented and the method is illustrated by its successful application to a number of simple problems from different categories.",

        "Wildfires in tropical rainforests and especially peat fires have abundant and wide-ranging negative effects on the economy, ecology and human health. Indonesia has large areas of peat swamp forests that recurrently burn. The use of fire is the most common method for land clearing in Indonesia. As a reaction to the devastating fire events of 2015, the provincial government of Jambi reimposed a more stringent version of the prohibition of burning land, delegalizing this land clearing method for smallholders. From a local perspective through qualitative research at the village level it becomes clear that this regulation is maladaptive as the underlying cause making land prone to fires, the sinking ground water table, remains unchanged by the ban. Further, the impacts of the new regulation vary for different groups of the local population, with severe land management restrictions for food crop farmers. The application of a framework on the political and material dimension of vulnerability reveals that the national policy unintentionally causes economic hardship and landscape changes at the local level. Hence, smallholders have experienced a two-fold perturbation caused by the fires’ impacts and the reinforced ban on burning land.\r\n",

While transnational development of hydrocarbons in the Sea of Okhotsk is in the spotlight, the socio-cultural milieu and ecological settings in which extraction occurs is also replete with change. As in resource peripheries in other global locales, long-time residents of Sakhalin and Kamchatka question their cultural identities, socioeconomic futures and rights to land and resources as transnational development continues, leading to multiple politicized actions related to the environment.",
        "Cultural tourism experiences provide opportunities for cultural exchange between the host culture and visitors. With growing interest in indigenous tourism, the extent of indigenous control over cultural content and representation becomes increasingly important. In mana-ging interpretation processes, guides have an influential role in facilitating understanding and appreciation in visitors, thereby fostering respect for indigenous cultural heritage. In a guided tour this exchange is facilitated by the tour guide who needs to consider the diversity of the visitors’ characteristics. By taking a visitor-centred approach to guiding and interpretation, guides adjust the way the experience is managed so that it is interesting, meaningful and relevant. ",
        "Hong Kong is often portrayed as a water abundant city because of its location in the subtropical zone. However, Hong Kong currently imports large volumes from the Dongjiang-Shenzhen Water Supply Project (DSWS Project) due to low local freshwater availability. The water situation is becoming more complicated with the popula-tion growth, economic development and difficulties in response/management. In addition, studies show that climate change is likely to increase rainfall variability, flood and drought events and damage water supply infrastructure in Hong Kong. Hence, ensuring sufficient freshwater availability is the major water management challenge for Hong Kong. This article discusses the issues in the current water supply system and also highlights the six interrelated risks within the context of climate change, namely: drought, rainstorm/flood events, sea-level rise, water pollution, social management and policy gaps in Hong Kong. In conclusion, it suggests that for a sustainable future, Honk Kong needs to invest in improving water self-sufficiency, diversify water sources and conduct aggressive public awareness to  increase individual adaptation to predicted climate change impacts.",

Implemented and organised by a village community without external assistance, this highly this culturally specific custom is an example of development on a local level. According to theorists and practitioners working on development issues, such a strategy for Community Development (CD) is promising because it seizes current approaches as it fosters local, decentralised, cultural specific development and aims at a high level of local participation. This research note analyses a yavirau as an example of CD, showing its advantages as well as its limitations.",

It is argued that the social and political ‘lessons’ of Minamata constitute a type of ‘negative heritage’ that presents a microcosm of many of the problems associated with modernity in Japan. Similarities between Minamata and the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident are discussed and some reasons why the negative heritage of Minamata was ignored at Fukushima are briefly considered.",
        "Model output statistics (MOS) methods can be used to empirically relate an environmental variable of interest to predictions\r\nfrom earth system models (ESMs). This variable often belongs to a spatial scale not resolved by the ESM. Here, using the linear\r\nmodel fitted by least squares, we regress monthly mean streamflow of the Rhine River at Lobith and Basel against seasonal\r\npredictions of precipitation, surface air temperature, and runoff from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.\r\nTo address potential effects of a scale mismatch between the ESM's horizontal grid resolution and the hydrological application,\r\nthe MOS method is further tested with an experiment conducted at the subcatchment scale. This experiment applies the MOS method\r\nto 133 additional gauging stations located within the Rhine basin and combines the forecasts from the subcatchments to predict\r\nstreamflow at Lobith and Basel. In doing so, the MOS method is tested for catchments areas covering 4 orders of magnitude.\r\nUsing data from the period 1981–2011, the results show that skill, with respect to climatology, is restricted on average to\r\nthe first month ahead. This result holds for both the predictor combination that mimics the initial conditions and the\r\npredictor combinations that additionally include the dynamical seasonal predictions. The latter, however, reduce the mean\r\nabsolute error of the former in the range of 5 to 12 %, which is consistently reproduced at the subcatchment scale.\r\nAn additional experiment conducted for 5-day mean streamflow indicates that the dynamical predictions help to reduce\r\nuncertainties up to about 20 days ahead, but it also reveals some shortcomings of the present MOS method.",
        "One of the main challenges for global hydrological modelling is the limited\navailability of observational data for calibration and model verification.\nThis is particularly the case for real-time applications. This problem could\npotentially be overcome if discharge measurements based on satellite data\nwere sufficiently accurate to substitute for ground-based measurements. The\naim of this study is to test the potentials and constraints of the remote\nsensing signal of the Global Flood Detection System for converting the flood\ndetection signal into river discharge values.\n<br><br>\nThe study uses data for 322 river measurement locations in Africa, Asia,\nEurope, North America and South America. Satellite discharge measurements\nwere calibrated for these sites and a validation analysis with in situ\ndischarge was performed. The locations with very good performance will be\nused in a future project where satellite discharge measurements are obtained\non a daily basis to fill the gaps where real-time ground observations are\nnot available. These include several international river locations in\nAfrica: the Niger, Volta and Zambezi rivers.\n<br><br>\nAnalysis of the potential factors affecting the satellite signal was based\non a classification decision tree (random forest) and showed that mean\ndischarge, climatic region, land cover and upstream catchment area are the\ndominant variables which determine good or poor performance of the\nmeasure\\-ment sites. In general terms, higher skill scores were obtained for\nlocations with one or more of the following characteristics: a river width\nhigher than 1km; a large floodplain area and in flooded forest, a\npotential flooded area greater than 40%; sparse vegetation, croplands or\ngrasslands and closed to open and open forest; leaf area index > 2;\ntropical climatic area; and without hydraulic infrastructures. Also,\nlocations where river ice cover is seasonally present obtained higher skill\nscores.

        "New automated methods are developed for identifying narrow landscape features\nthat cause hydrodynamic blocking and might have critical impacts for\nmanagement models of river flooding, coastal inundation, climate change, or\nextreme event analysis. Lidar data processed into a fine-resolution raster\n(1 m × 1 m) can resolve narrow blocking features in topography\nbut typically cannot be directly used for hydrodynamic modeling. For\npractical applications such data are abstracted to larger scales, which can\nresult in a loss of hydrodynamic blocking effects. The traditional approach\nto resolving hydrodynamic blocking features is to represent them as cell\nboundaries within a customized unstructured grid that is tuned to the spatial\nfeatures. A new automated edge-blocking approach is developed, which allows\napplication of an arbitrarily structured (Cartesian) mesh at coarser scales and\nprovides contiguous representation of blocking features along Cartesian cell\nboundaries. This approach distorts the shape of a blocking feature (i.e.,\nmaking it rectilinear along grid cell faces) but retains its critical\nhydrodynamic blocking height characteristics and spatial continuity within\nthe topographic model.",
        "This article presents a methodology for estimating flood risk in urban areas\nintegrating pluvial flooding, river flooding and failure of both small and\nlarge dams.

The second part describes the proposed methodology, which\npresents an integrated approach – combining pluvial, river flooding and\nflooding from dam failure, as applied to a case study: an urban area located\ndownstream of a dam under construction. The methodology enhances the\napproach developed within the SUFRI project (\"Sustainable Strategies of\nUrban Flood Risk Management to cope with the residual risk\", 2009–2011).\nThis article also shows how outcomes from flood risk analysis provide better\nand more complete information to inform authorities, local entities and the\nstakeholders involved in decision-making with regard to flood risk\nmanagement.",
        "This paper proposes a method of valuing the stock of residential buildings\nin Spain as the first step in assessing possible damage caused to them by\nnatural hazards.

Using dasymetric disaggregation\nprocesses and GIS techniques we developed a geolocalized method of obtaining\nthis information, which was the exposure variable in the general risk assessment\nformula. Then, with the application over a hazard map, the risk value can\nbe easily obtained. An example of its application is given in a case study\nthat assesses the risk of a landslide in the entire 23 200 km<sup>2</sup> of the\nValencia Autonomous Community (NUT2), the results of which are analysed by\nmunicipal areas (LAU2) for the years 2005 and 2009.",
        "The tsunami generated on 12 July 1993 by the Hokkaido–Nansei–Oki earthquake\n(<i>M</i><sub>w</sub> = 7.8)  brought about a maximum wave run-up of 31.7 m, the\nhighest recorded in Japan during the 20th century, near the Monai Valley on the west\ncoast of  Okushiri Island (Hokkaido Tsunami Survey Group, 1993). To\nreproduce the extreme run-up height, the three-dimensional non-hydrostatic\nmodel (Flow Science, 2012), referred to here as the NH-model, has been locally applied with\nopen boundary conditions supplied in an offline manner by the\nthree-dimensional hydrostatic model (Ribeiro et al., 2011), referred to here as the\nH-model. The area of the H-model is sufficiently large to cover the entire fault\nregion with one-way nested multiple domains. For the initial water\ndeformation, Okada's fault model (1985) using the sub-fault parameters is\napplied.\n<br><br>\nThree NH-model experiments have been performed, namely without islands, with one island and with two islands.

        "In the sub-Saharan Sahel, energy and water cycling at the land surface is\npivotal for the regional climate, water resources and land productivity, yet it\nis still very poorly documented. As a step towards a comprehensive\nclimatological description of surface fluxes in this area, this study\nprovides estimates of long-term average annual budgets and seasonal cycles\nfor two main land use types of the cultivated Sahelian belt: rainfed millet\ncrop and fallow bush. These estimates build on the combination of a 7-year\nfield data set from two typical plots in southwestern Niger with detailed\nphysically based soil–plant–atmosphere modeling, yielding a continuous,\ncomprehensive set of water and energy flux and storage variables over this\nmultiyear period. In the present case in particular, blending field data with\nmechanistic modeling makes the best use of available data and knowledge for\nthe construction of the multivariate time series. Rather than using the\nmodel only to gap-fill observations into a composite series, model–data\nintegration is generalized homogeneously over time by generating the whole\nseries with the entire data-constrained model simulation. Climatological\naverages of all water and energy variables, with associated sampling\nuncertainty, are derived at annual to sub-seasonal scales from the time\nseries produced. Similarities and differences in the two ecosystem behaviors\nare highlighted. Mean annual evapotranspiration is found to represent\n~82–85% of rainfall for both systems, but with different\nsoil evaporation/plant transpiration partitioning and different seasonal\ndistribution. The remainder consists entirely of runoff for the fallow,\nwhereas drainage and runoff stand in a 40–60% proportion for the millet\nfield. These results should provide a robust reference for the surface\nenergy- and water-related studies needed in this region. Their significance\nand the benefits they gain from the innovative data–model integration\napproach are thoroughly discussed. The model developed in this context has\nthe potential for reliable simulations outside the reported conditions,\nincluding changing climate and land cover.",
        "The La Bassée floodplain area is a large groundwater reservoir\r\ncontrolling most of the water exchanged between local aquifers and\r\nhydrographic networks within the Seine River basin (France). Preferential\r\nflows depend essentially on the heterogeneity of alluvial plain infilling,\r\nwhose characteristics are strongly influenced by the presence of mud plugs\r\n(paleomeander clayey infilling). These mud plugs strongly contrast with the\r\ncoarse sand material that composes most of the alluvial plain, and can create\r\npermeability barriers to groundwater flows. A detailed knowledge of the\r\nglobal and internal geometry of such paleomeanders can thus lead to a\r\ncomprehensive understanding of the long-term hydrogeological processes of the\r\nalluvial plain.

        "This paper presents a case study centred on the Murrumbidgee River basin in\neastern Australia. It illustrates the dynamics of the balance between water\nextraction and use for food production, and efforts to mitigate and reverse\nconsequent degradation of the riparian environment. In particular, the paper\ntraces the history of a pendulum swing between an exclusive focus on\nagricultural development and food production in the initial stages and its\nattendant socio-economic benefits, followed by the gradual realization of the\nadverse environmental impacts, subsequent efforts to mitigate these with the\nuse of remedial measures, and ultimately concerted efforts and externally\nimposed solutions to restore environmental health and ecosystem services. The\n100-year history of development within the Murrumbidgee is divided into four\neras, each underpinned by the dominance of different values and norms and\nturning points characterized by their changes. The various stages of\ndevelopment can be characterized by the dominance, in turn, of infrastructure\nsystems, policy frameworks, economic instruments, and technological\nsolutions. The paper argues that, to avoid these costly pendulum swings,\nmanagement needs to be underpinned by long-term coupled socio-hydrologic\nsystem models that explicitly include the two-way coupling between human and\nhydrological systems, including the slow evolution of human values and norms\nrelating to water and the environment. Such coupled human–water system\nmodels can provide insights into dominant controls of the trajectory of their\nco-evolution in a given system, and can also be used to interpret patterns of\nco-evolution of such coupled systems in different places across gradients of\nclimatic, socio-economic and socio-cultural conditions, and in this way to\nhelp develop generalizable understanding.",
        "A global constant value of the extinction coefficient (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub>) is\nusually specified in lake models to parameterize water clarity. This study\naimed to improve the performance of the 1-D freshwater lake (FLake) model\nusing satellite-derived <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> for Lake Erie. The CoastColour\nalgorithm was applied to MERIS satellite imagery to estimate <i>K</i><sub>d</sub>.\nThe constant (0.2 m<sup>−1</sup>) and satellite-derived <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> values\nas well as radiation fluxes and meteorological station observations were then\nused to run FLake for a meteorological station on Lake Erie.

No\nsignificant improvement was found in FLake-simulated lake surface water\ntemperature (LSWT) when <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> variations in time were considered\nusing a monthly average. Therefore, results suggest that a time-independent,\nlake-specific, and constant satellite-derived <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> value can\nreproduce LSWT with sufficient accuracy for the Lake Erie station.\n<br><br>A sensitivity analysis was also performed to assess the impact of various\n<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> values on the simulation outputs. Results show that FLake is\nsensitive to variations in <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> to estimate the thermal structure\nof Lake Erie. Dark waters result in warmer spring and colder fall\ntemperatures compared to clear waters. Dark waters always produce colder mean\nwater column temperature (MWCT) and lake bottom water temperature (LBWT),\nshallower mixed layer depth (MLD), longer ice cover duration, and thicker\nice.

        "An understanding of potential stream water quality conditions under future\nclimate is critical for the sustainability of ecosystems and the protection of\nhuman health. Changes in wetland water balance under projected climate could\nalter wetland extent or cause wetland loss (e.g., via increased\nevapotranspiration and lower growing season flows leading to reduced riparian\nwetland inundation) or altered land use patterns. This study assessed the\npotential climate-induced changes to in-stream sediment and nutrient loads\nin the snowmelt-dominated Sprague River, Oregon, western US.\nAdditionally, potential water quality impacts of combined changes in wetland\nwater balance and wetland area under future climatic conditions were\nevaluated. The study utilized the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)\nforced with statistical downscaling of general circulation model (GCM) data\nfrom the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) using the\nMultivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) method. Our findings suggest\nthat, in the Sprague River, (1) mid-21st century nutrient and sediment loads\ncould increase significantly during the high-flow season under warmer, wetter\nclimate projections or could change only nominally in a warmer and somewhat\ndrier future; (2) although water quality conditions under some future climate\nscenarios and no wetland loss may be similar to the past, the combined impact\nof climate change and wetland losses on nutrient loads could be large; (3)\nincreases in stream total phosphorus (TP) concentration with wetland loss\nunder future climate scenarios would be greatest at high-magnitude,\nlow-probability flows; and (4) loss of riparian wetlands in both headwaters\nand lowlands could increase outlet TP loads to a similar degree, but this\ncould be due to distinctly different mechanisms in different parts of the watershed.",
        "Internal hydraulic control, which occurs when stratified water masses are\r\nforced through an abrupt constriction, plays an enormous role in nature on\r\nboth large and regional scales with respect to dynamics, circulation, and water\r\nmass formation. Despite a growing literature on this subject surprisingly few\r\ndirect observations have been made that conclusively show the existence of\r\nand the circumstances related to internal hydraulic control in nature. In\r\nthis study we present observations from the Little Belt, Denmark, one of\r\nthree narrow straits connecting the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. The\r\nobservations (comprised primarily of along-strait, detailed transects of\r\nsalinity and temperature; continuous observations of flow velocity, salinity,\r\nand temperature at a permanent station; and numerous vertical profiles of\r\nsalinity, temperature, fluorescence, and flow velocity in various locations)\r\nshow that internal hydraulic control is a frequently occurring phenomenon in\r\nthe Little Belt. The observations, which are limited to south-going flows of\r\napproximately two-layered water masses, show that internal hydraulic control\r\nmay take either of two configurations, i.e. the lower or the upper layer\r\nbeing the active, accelerating one. This is connected to the depth of the\r\npycnocline on the upstream side and the topography, which is both deepening\r\nand contracting toward the narrow part of the Little Belt. The existence of\r\ntwo possible flow configurations is known from theoretical and laboratory\r\nstudies, but we believe that this has never been observed in nature and reported before. The water masses formed by the intense mixing, which is tightly\r\nconnected with the presence of control, may be found far downstream of the\r\npoint of control. The observations show that these particular water masses\r\nare associated with chlorophyll concentrations that are considerably higher\r\nthan in adjacent water masses, showing that control has a considerable\r\ninfluence on the primary production and hence the ecosystem in the area.",
        "Only two months after a huge forest fire occurred in the upper part of a\r\nvalley located in central Portugal, several debris flows were triggered by\r\nintense rainfall. The event caused infrastructural and economic damage,\r\nalthough no lives were lost. The present research aims to simulate the run-out\r\nof two debris flows that occurred during the event as well as to calculate\r\nvia back-analysis the rheological parameters and the excess rain involved. Thus,\r\na dynamic model was used, which integrates surface runoff, concentrated\r\nerosion along the channels, propagation and deposition of flow material.\r\nAfterwards, the model was validated using 32 debris flows triggered during\r\nthe same event that were not considered for calibration. The rheological and\r\nentrainment parameters obtained for the most accurate simulation were then\r\nused to perform three scenarios of debris flow run-out on the basin scale.\r\nThe results were confronted with the existing buildings exposed in the\r\nstudy area and the worst-case scenario showed a potential inundation that may\r\naffect 345 buildings. In addition, six streams where debris flow occurred in\r\nthe past and caused material damage and loss of lives were identified.",
        "Etrophication and flooding are perennial problems in agricultural watersheds\r\nof the northern Great Plains. A high proportion of annual runoff and nutrient\r\ntransport occurs with snowmelt in this region. Extensive surface drainage\r\nmodification, frozen soils, and frequent backwater or\r\nice-damming impacts on flow measurement represent unique challenges to accurately\r\nmodelling watershed-scale hydrological processes. A physically based,\r\nnon-calibrated model created using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling\r\nplatform (CRHM) was parameterized to simulate hydrological processes within a\r\nlow slope, clay soil, and intensively surface drained agricultural watershed.\r\nThese characteristics are common to most tributaries of the Red River of the\r\nnorth. Analysis of the observed water level records for the study watershed\r\n(La Salle River) indicates that ice cover and backwater issues at time of\r\npeak flow may impact the accuracy of both modelled and measured streamflows,\r\nhighlighting the value of evaluating a non-calibrated model in this\r\nenvironment. Simulations best matched the streamflow record in years when\r\npeak and annual discharges were equal to or above the medians of\r\n6.7 m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and 1.25  × 10<sup>7</sup> m<sup>3</sup>, respectively, with\r\nan average Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.76. Simulation of low-flow\r\nyears (below the medians) was more challenging (average NSE  &lt;  0), with\r\nsimulated discharge overestimated by 90 % on average. This result\r\nindicates the need for improved understanding of hydrological response in the\r\nwatershed under drier conditions. Simulation during dry years was improved\r\nwhen infiltration was allowed prior to soil thaw, indicating the potential\r\nimportance of preferential flow. Representation of in-channel dynamics and\r\ntravel time under the flooded or ice-jam conditions should also receive\r\nattention in further model development efforts. Despite the complexities of\r\nthe study watershed, simulations of flow for average to high-flow years and\r\nother components of the water balance were robust (snow water equivalency\r\n(SWE) and soil moisture). A sensitivity analysis of the flow routing model\r\nsuggests a need for improved understanding of watershed functions under both\r\ndry and flooded conditions due to dynamic routing conditions, but overall\r\nCRHM is appropriate for simulation of hydrological processes in agricultural\r\nwatersheds of the Red River. Falsifications of snow sublimation, snow\r\ntransport, and infiltration to frozen soil processes in the validated base\r\nmodel indicate that these processes were very influential in stream discharge\r\ngeneration.",

        "An aquifer consisting of a skin zone and a formation zone is considered as a\ntwo-zone aquifer. Existing solutions for the problem of constant-flux\npumping in a two-zone confined aquifer involve laborious calculation. This\nstudy develops a new approximate solution for the problem based on a\nmathematical model describing steady-state radial and vertical flows in a\ntwo-zone aquifer. Hydraulic parameters in these two zones can be different\nbut are assumed homogeneous in each zone. A partially penetrating well may\nbe treated as the Neumann condition with a known flux along the screened\npart and zero flux along the unscreened part. The aquifer domain is finite\nwith an outer circle boundary treated as the Dirichlet condition. The\nsteady-state drawdown solution of the model is derived by the finite Fourier\ncosine transform. Then, an approximate transient solution is developed by\nreplacing the radius of the aquifer domain in the steady-state solution with\nan analytical expression for a dimensionless time-dependent radius of\ninfluence. The approximate solution is capable of predicting good temporal\ndrawdown distributions over the whole pumping period except at the early\nstage. A quantitative criterion for the validity of neglecting the vertical\nflow due to a partially penetrating well is also provided. Conventional\nmodels considering radial flow without the vertical component for the\nconstant-flux pumping have good accuracy if satisfying the criterion.",

        "The stream character as such and its discharge behavior are the gross results of a range of events and functions of nature. The word 'stream flow', as used in the present text, is referred to 'catchment yield'. This yield is obviously discharge, q, which has dimensions of volume, L3, and time, T, expressed here onwards in cumec (one cubic metre per second) which will ultimately be converted into a single voluminous unit litre (1) and hence referred to as Q. As the_ Gola River is a spring fed river,, its discharge behaviour is absolutely dependent on the sub-surface flow of Siwalik{ Ranges. It has been noticed that the sub-surface flow fluctuates according to the monsoonal and non-monsoonal precipitation intensity. Hence, an interesting seasonal rhythm is noticed in the monsoonal and non-monsoonal discharge with the changing values of stream magnitude and velocity.",
        "Accurate measurements of rainfall are important in many hydrological and\nmeteorological applications, for instance, flash-flood early-warning systems,\nhydraulic structures design, irrigation, weather forecasting, and climate\nmodelling.

In order to disentangle these\nsources of uncertainty, we classified them into two categories: (1) those\nassociated with the individual microwave link measurements, i.e. the errors\ninvolved in link rainfall retrievals, such as wet\nantenna attenuation, sampling interval of measurements, wet/dry period\nclassification, dry weather baseline attenuation, quantization of the\nreceived power, drop size distribution (DSD), and multi-path propagation; and\n(2) those associated with mapping, i.e. the combined effect of the\ninterpolation methodology and the spatial density of link measurements.\n<br><br>\nWe computed ~ 3500 rainfall maps from real and simulated link rainfall\ndepths for 12 days for the land surface of the Netherlands. Simulated link\nrainfall depths refer to path-averaged rainfall depths obtained from radar\ndata. The ~ 3500 real and simulated rainfall maps were compared against\nquality-controlled gauge-adjusted radar rainfall fields (assumed to be the\nground truth). Thus, we were able to not only identify and quantify the\nsources of uncertainty in such rainfall maps, but also test the actual and\noptimal performance of one commercial microwave network from one of the\ncellular providers in the Netherlands. Errors in microwave link measurements\nwere found to be the source that contributes most to the overall uncertainty.",

        "Thirty-year time series of hindcast wave data were\r\nanalysed for 10 coastal locations along the eastern Mexican coast to obtain\r\ninformation about storm events occurring in the region, with the goal of\r\nexamining the possible presence of interannual trends in the number of\r\nstorm-wave events and their main features (wave height, duration and energy\r\ncontent). The storms were defined according to their significant wave height\r\nand duration, and the events were classified as related to either tropical\r\ncyclones or Norte events. The occurrence and characteristics of both types of\r\nevents were analysed independently. There is no statistically significant\r\nchange in the number of storm-wave events related to Nortes or their\r\ncharacteristics during the study period. However, there is a subtle increase\r\nin the number of events related to tropical cyclones in the western Caribbean\r\nregion and a more evident increase in wave height and energy content of these\r\nevents.",
        "The seasonal and year-to-year variability of the phytoplankton size class\n(PSC) spatial distribution has been examined in the Mediterranean Sea by\nusing the entire time series of Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor\n(SeaWiFS) space observations (1998–2010). Daily maps of PSCs have been\ndetermined using an empirical model based on a synoptic relationship between\nsurface chlorophyll <i>a</i> and diagnostic pigments referred to different\ntaxonomic groups. The analysis of micro-, nano- and pico-phytoplankton\nsatellite time series (1998–2010) describes, quantitatively, the algal\nassemblage structure over the basin and reveals that the main contribution to\nchlorophyll <i>a</i> in most of the Mediterranean Sea comes from the\npico-phytoplankton component, especially in nutrient-poor environments.\nRegions with different and peculiar features are the Northwestern\nMediterranean Sea, the Alborán Sea and several coastal areas, such as the\nNorth Adriatic Sea. In these areas, local interactions between physical and\nbiological components modulate the composition of the three phytoplankton\nsize classes. It results that, during the spring bloom season,\nmicro-phytoplankton dominates in areas of intense vertical winter mixing and\ndeep/intermediate water formation, while in coastal areas micro-phytoplankton\ndominates in all seasons because of the nutrient supply from the terrestrial\ninputs. In the Alborán Sea, where the Atlantic inflow modulates the\nnutrient availability, any predominance of one class over the other two has\nbeen observed. The nano-phytoplankton component instead remains widespread\nover the entire basin along the year, and its contribution to chlorophyll <i>a</i>\nis of the order of 30–40 %. The largest inter-annual signal occurs in\nthe Northwestern Mediterranean Sea, driven by the year-to-year variation in\nintensity and extension of the spring bloom, followed by the Alborán Sea,\nin which the inter-annual variability is strongly modulated by the Atlantic\ninflow.\n\nIn absence of sufficient in situ data of community composition, the\nsatellite-based analysis demonstrated that pico-, nano- and micro-phytoplankton classes\noften coexist. The predominance of one group over the other ones is strongly\ndependent on the physical and biological processes occurring at the mesoscale. These\nprocesses directly influence the nutrient and light availability, which are\nthe principal forcing for the algae growth.",
        "When designing or maintaining an hydraulic structure, an estimate of the\nfrequency and magnitude of extreme events is required. The most common\nmethods to obtain such estimates rely on the assumption of stationarity,\ni.e. the assumption that the stochastic process under study is not changing.\nThe public perception and worry of a changing climate have led to a wide\ndebate on the validity of this assumption. In this work trends for annual and\nseasonal maxima in peak river flow and catchment-average daily rainfall are\nexplored. Assuming a two-parameter log-normal distribution, a linear\nregression model is applied, allowing the mean of the distribution to vary\nwith time. For the river flow data, the linear model is extended to include\nan additional variable, the 99th percentile of the daily rainfall for a year.\nFrom the fitted models, dimensionless magnification factors are estimated and\nplotted on a map, shedding light on whether or not geographical coherence can\nbe found in the significant changes. The implications of the identified\ntrends from a decision-making perspective are then discussed, in particular\nwith regard to the Type I and Type II error probabilities. One striking\nfeature of the estimated trends is that the high variability found in the\ndata leads to very inconclusive test results. Indeed, for most stations it is\nimpossible to make a statement regarding whether or not the current design\nstandards for the 2085 horizon can be considered precautionary. The power of\ntests on trends is further discussed in the light of statistical power\nanalysis and sample size calculations. Given the observed variability in the\ndata, sample sizes of some hundreds of years would be needed to confirm or\nnegate the current safety margins when using at-site analysis.",
        "Self-organized landscape patterning can arise in response to multiple\nprocesses. Discriminating among alternative patterning mechanisms,\nparticularly where experimental manipulations are untenable, requires\nprocess-based models. Previous modeling studies have attributed patterning\nin the Everglades (Florida, USA) to sediment redistribution and anisotropic\nsoil hydraulic properties. In this work, we tested an alternate theory, the\nself-organizing-canal (SOC) hypothesis, by developing a cellular automata\nmodel that simulates pattern evolution via local positive feedbacks (i.e.,\nfacilitation) coupled with a global negative feedback based on hydrology.\nThe model is forced by global hydroperiod that drives stochastic transitions\nbetween two patch types: ridge (higher elevation) and slough (lower\nelevation). We evaluated model performance using multiple criteria based on\nsix statistical and geostatistical properties observed in reference portions\nof the Everglades landscape: patch density, patch anisotropy, semivariogram\nranges, power-law scaling of ridge areas, perimeter area fractal dimension,\nand characteristic pattern wavelength. Model results showed strong\nstatistical agreement with reference landscapes, but only when\nanisotropically acting local facilitation was coupled with hydrologic global\nfeedback, for which several plausible mechanisms exist. Critically, the\nmodel correctly generated fractal landscapes that had no characteristic\npattern wavelength, supporting the invocation of global rather than\nscale-specific negative feedbacks.",
        "Global warming is expected to intensify the Earth's hydrological cycle and\r\nincrease flood and drought risks. Changes over the 21st century under two\r\nwarming scenarios in different percentiles of the probability distribution\r\nof streamflow, and particularly of high and low streamflow extremes\r\n(95th and 5th percentiles), are analyzed using an ensemble of\r\nbias-corrected global climate model (GCM) fields fed into different global\r\nhydrological models (GHMs) provided by the\r\nInter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP) to understand the changes in streamflow\r\ndistribution and simultaneous vulnerability to different types of\r\nhydrological risk in different regions. In the multi-model mean under the\r\nRepresentative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5)\r\nscenario, 37 % of global land areas experience an increase in magnitude of\r\nextremely high streamflow (with an average increase of 24.5 %),\r\npotentially increasing the chance of flooding in those regions. On the other\r\nhand, 43 % of global land areas show a decrease in the magnitude of\r\nextremely low streamflow (average decrease of 51.5 %), potentially\r\nincreasing the chance of drought in those regions. About 10 % of the\r\nglobal land area is projected to face simultaneously increasing high extreme\r\nstreamflow and decreasing low extreme streamflow, reflecting the potentially\r\nworsening hazard of both flood and drought; further, these regions tend to\r\nbe highly populated parts of the globe, currently holding around 30 % of\r\nthe world's population (over 2.1 billion people). In a world more than 4°\r\nwarmer by the end of the 21st century compared to the\r\npre-industrial era (RCP8.5 scenario), changes in magnitude of streamflow\r\nextremes are projected to be about twice as large as in a 2° warmer\r\nworld (RCP2.6 scenario). Results also show that inter-GHM uncertainty in\r\nstreamflow changes, due to representation of terrestrial hydrology, is\r\ngreater than the inter-GCM uncertainty due to simulation of climate change.\r\nUnder both forcing scenarios, there is high model agreement for increases\r\nin streamflow of the regions near and above the Arctic Circle, and\r\nconsequent increases in the freshwater inflow to the Arctic Ocean, while\r\nsubtropical arid areas experience a reduction in streamflow.",
        "The intensity, duration, and geographic extent of floods in Bangladesh\nmostly depend on the combined influences of three river systems, the Ganges,\nBrahmaputra and Meghna (GBM). In addition, climate change is likely to have\nsignificant effects on the hydrology and water resources of the GBM basin\nand may ultimately lead to more serious floods in Bangladesh. However, the\nassessment of climate change impacts on the basin-scale hydrology by using\nwell-calibrated hydrologic modeling has seldom been conducted in the GBM basin\ndue to the lack of observed data for calibration and validation. In this\nstudy, a macroscale hydrologic model H08 has been applied over the basin at\na relatively fine grid resolution (10 km) by integrating the fine-resolution\nDEM (digital elevation model) data for accurate river networks delineation. The model has been\ncalibrated via the analysis of model parameter sensitivity and validated based on\nlong-term observed daily streamflow data. The impacts of climate change\n(considering a high-emissions path) on runoff, evapotranspiration, and soil\nmoisture are assessed by using five CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) GCMs (global circulation models) through three time-slice\nexperiments; the present-day (1979–2003), the near-future (2015–2039), and\nthe far-future (2075–2099) periods. Results show that, by the end of\n21st century, (a) the entire GBM basin is projected to be warmed by\n~4.3 °C; (b) the changes of mean precipitation\n(runoff) are projected to be +16.3% (+16.2%), +19.8%\n(+33.1%), and +29.6% (+39.7%) in the Brahmaputra, Ganges, and\nMeghna, respectively; and (c) evapotranspiration is projected to increase for the\nentire GBM (Brahmaputra: +16.4%, Ganges: +13.6%, Meghna:\n+12.9%) due to increased net radiation as well as warmer temperature.\nFuture changes of hydrologic variables are larger in the dry season\n(November–April) than in the wet season (May–October). Amongst the three basins, the\nMeghna shows the highest increase in runoff, indicating higher possibility\nof flood occurrence. The uncertainty due to the specification of key model\nparameters in model predictions is found to be low for estimated runoff,\nevapotranspiration and net radiation. However, the uncertainty in estimated\nsoil moisture is rather large with the coefficient of variation ranging from 14.4 to\n31% among the three basins.",
        "Snow avalanche motion is strongly dependent on the temperature and water\r\ncontent of the snow cover. In this paper we use a snow cover model, driven by\r\nmeasured meteorological data, to set the initial and boundary conditions for\r\nwet-snow avalanche calculations. The snow cover model provides estimates of\r\nsnow height, density, temperature and liquid water content. This information\r\nis used to prescribe fracture heights and erosion heights for an avalanche\r\ndynamics model. We compare simulated runout distances with observed avalanche\r\ndeposition fields using a contingency table analysis. Our analysis of the\r\nsimulations reveals a large variability in predicted runout for tracks with\r\nflat terraces and gradual slope transitions to the runout zone. Reliable\r\nestimates of avalanche mass (height and density) in the release and erosion\r\nzones are identified to be more important than an exact specification of\r\ntemperature and water content. For wet-snow avalanches, this implies that the\r\nlayers where meltwater accumulates in the release zone must be identified\r\naccurately as this defines the height of the fracture slab and therefore the\r\nrelease mass. Advanced thermomechanical models appear to be better suited to\r\nsimulate wet-snow avalanche inundation areas than existing\r\nguideline procedures if and only if accurate snow cover information is\r\navailable.",
        "An integrated approach was adopted over Faifa Mountain and its surroundings,\nin Saudi Arabia, to identify landslide types, distribution, and controlling\nfactors, and to generate landslide susceptibility maps. Given the\ninaccessibility of the area, we relied on remote sensing observations and\nGIS-based applications to enable spatial analysis of data and extrapolation\nof limited field observations. Susceptibility maps depicting debris flows\nwithin ephemeral valleys (Type I) and landslides caused by failure along\nfracture planes (Type II) were generated. Type I susceptibility maps were\ngenerated applying linear relationships between normalized difference\nvegetation index (NDVI) and threshold slope values (30°), both of\nwhich were extracted over known debris flow locations. For Type II\nsusceptibility maps, landslides were predicted if fracture planes had strike\nvalues similar to (within 20°) those of the slope face strike and dip\nangles exceeding the friction, but not the slope angles. Comparisons between\npredicted and observed debris flows yielded success rates of 82%\n(ephemeral valleys); unverified predictions are interpreted as future\nlocations of debris flows. Our approach could serve as a replicable model for\nmany areas worldwide, in areas where field measurements are difficult to\nobtain and/or are cost prohibitive.",
        "Accurate representation of the real spatio-temporal variability of catchment\nrainfall inputs is currently severely limited. Moreover, spatially\ninterpolated catchment precipitation is subject to large uncertainties,\nparticularly in developing countries and regions which are difficult to\naccess. Recently, satellite-based rainfall estimates (SREs) provide an\nunprecedented opportunity for a wide range of hydrological applications, from\nwater resources modelling to monitoring of extreme events such as droughts\nand floods.<br><br>This study attempts to exhaustively evaluate – for the first time – the\nsuitability of seven state-of-the-art SRE products (TMPA 3B42v7, CHIRPSv2,\nCMORPH, PERSIANN-CDR, PERSIAN-CCS-Adj, MSWEPv1.1, and PGFv3) over the complex\ntopography and diverse climatic gradients of Chile. Different temporal scales\n(daily, monthly, seasonal, annual) are used in a point-to-pixel comparison\nbetween precipitation time series measured at 366 stations (from sea level to\n4600 m a.s.l. in the Andean Plateau) and the corresponding grid cell of each\nSRE (rescaled to a 0.25° grid if necessary). The modified\nKling–Gupta efficiency was used to identify possible sources of systematic\nerrors in each SRE. In addition, five categorical indices (PC, POD, FAR, ETS,\nfBIAS) were used to assess the ability of each SRE to correctly identify\ndifferent precipitation intensities.<br><br>Results revealed that most SRE products performed better for the humid South\n(36.4–43.7° S) and Central Chile (32.18–36.4° S), in\nparticular at low- and mid-elevation zones (0–1000 m a.s.l.) compared to the\narid northern regions and the Far South. Seasonally, all products performed\nbest during the wet seasons (autumn and winter; MAM–JJA) compared to summer\n(DJF) and spring (SON). In addition, all SREs were able to correctly identify\nthe occurrence of no-rain events, but they presented a low skill in\nclassifying precipitation intensities during rainy days. Overall, PGFv3\nexhibited the best performance everywhere and for all timescales, which can\nbe clearly attributed to its bias-correction procedure using 217 stations\nfrom Chile. Good results were also obtained by the research products\nCHIRPSv2, TMPA 3B42v7 and MSWEPv1.1, while CMORPH, PERSIANN-CDR, and the\nreal-time PERSIANN-CCS-Adj were less skillful in representing observed\nrainfall. While PGFv3 (currently available up to 2010) might be used in Chile\nfor historical analyses and calibration of hydrological models, the high\nspatial resolution, low latency and long data records of CHIRPS and TMPA\n3B42v7 (in transition to IMERG) show promising potential to be used in\nmeteorological studies and water resource assessments. We finally conclude\nthat despite improvements of most SRE products, a site-specific assessment is\nstill needed before any use in catchment-scale hydrological studies.",
        "The impact of water policy on conserving the Ogallala Aquifer in Groundwater\r\nManagement District 3 (GMD3) in southwestern Kansas is analyzed using a\r\nsystem-level theoretical approach integrating agricultural water and land use\r\npatterns, changing climate, economic trends, and population dynamics. In so\r\ndoing, we (1) model the current hyper-extractive coupled natural&ndash;human (CNH) system, (2) forecast outcomes of policy scenarios transitioning the current groundwater-based economic system toward more sustainable paths for the social, economic, and natural components of the integrated system, and (3) develop public policy options for enhanced conservation while minimizing the economic costs for the region's communities. The findings corroborate previous studies showing that conservation often leads initially to an expansion of irrigation activities. However, we also find that the expanded presence of irrigated acreage reduces the impact of an increasingly drier climate on the region's economy and creates greater long-term stability in\r\nthe farming sector along with increased employment and population in the\r\nregion. On the negative side, conservation lowers the net present value of\r\nfarmers' current investments and there is not a policy scenario that achieves\r\na truly sustainable solution as defined by Peter H. Gleick. This study\r\nreinforces the salience of interdisciplinary linked CNH models to provide\r\npolicy prescriptions to untangle and address significant environmental policy issues.",
        "The research aimed to analyze selected properties of peat degradation on different land uses and the sustainable management. The research area is located in the lowland dome peats in the catchment basin of Sibumbung River and Sibotak River in Sub District of East Pedamaran, OKI South Sumatra. The research method used an experimental design of Randomized Completely Block Design with two Blocks and five treatments (Site A: intercropping between oil palm and pineapples; Site B: oil palm plantations, Site C: peat forest; Site D: swamp bush; Site E: swamp grass). The research resulted that drainage and land uses decrease some properties of peats, namely C/N ratio, total pore space, fiber and ash content as well as organic C on cultivated peats and are significantly different at level of 5% compared with uncultivated peats. Bulk density increased due to peat compaction and groundwater table on cultivated peats, which is getting deeper, and significantly different compared with uncultivated peats. All soil series do not show any change because of drainage and different land uses. Sustainable peat management can be implemented through three approaches, namely managements of water, soil and crops.",
        "The Northeast China Transect (NECT) is one of the International\nGeosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) terrestrial transects, where there is a\nsignificant precipitation gradient from east to west, as well as a vegetation\ntransition of forest&ndash;grassland&ndash;desert. It is remarkable to understand vegetation distribution and dynamics under climate change in this transect. We take canopy cover (<i>M</i>), derived from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as an index to describe the properties of vegetation\ndistribution and dynamics in the NECT. In Eagleson's ecohydrological optimality\ntheory, the optimal canopy cover (<i>M</i>*) is determined by the trade-off\nbetween water supply depending on water balance and water demand depending on\ncanopy transpiration. We apply Eagleson's ecohydrological optimality method\nin the NECT based on data from 2000 to 2013 to get <i>M</i>*, which is compared with <i>M</i> from NDVI to further discuss the sensitivity of <i>M</i>* to vegetation properties and climate factors. The result indicates that the average <i>M</i>* fits the actual <i>M</i> well (for forest, <i>M</i>*  =  0.822 while <i>M</i>  =  0.826; for grassland, <i>M</i>*  =  0.353 while <i>M</i>  =  0.352; the\ncorrelation coefficient between <i>M</i> and <i>M</i>* is 0.81). Results of water balance also match the field-measured data in the references. The sensitivity analyses show that <i>M</i>* decreases with the increase of leaf area index (LAI), stem fraction and temperature, while it increases with the increase of leaf angle and precipitation amount. Eagleson's ecohydrological optimality method offers a quantitative way to understand the impacts of climate change on canopy cover and provides guidelines for ecorestoration projects.",
        "Corporations, industries and non-governmental\norganizations have become increasingly concerned with growing water risks in\nmany parts of the world. Most of the focus has been on water scarcity and\ncompetition for the resource between agriculture, urban users, ecology and\nindustry. However, water risks are multi-dimensional. Water-related hazards\ninclude flooding due to extreme rainfall, persistent drought and pollution,\neither due to industrial operations themselves, or to the failure of\ninfrastructure. Most companies have risk management plans at each\noperational location to address these risks to a certain design level. The\nresidual risk may or may not be managed, and is typically not quantified at\na portfolio scale, i.e. across many sites. Given that climate is the driver\nof many of these extreme events, and there is evidence of quasi-periodic\nclimate regimes at inter-annual and decadal timescales, it is possible that\na portfolio is subject to persistent, multi-year exceedances of the design\nlevel. In other words, for a multi-national corporation, it is possible that\nthere is correlation in the climate-induced portfolio water risk across its\noperational sites as multiple sites may experience a hazard beyond the\ndesign level in a given year. Therefore, from an investor's perspective, a\nneed exists for a water risk index that allows for an exploration of the\npossible space and/or time clustering in exposure across many sites\ncontained in a portfolio. This paper represents a first attempt to develop\nan index for financial exposure of a geographically diversified, global\nportfolio to the time-varying risk of climatic extremes using long daily\nglobal rainfall datasets derived from climate re-analysis models. Focusing\non extreme daily rainfall amounts and using examples from major mining\ncompanies, we illustrate how the index can be developed. We discuss how\ncompanies can use it to explore their corporate exposure, and what they may\nneed to disclose to investors and regulators to promote transparency as to\nrisk exposure and mitigation efforts. For the examples of mining companies\nprovided, we note that the actual exposure is substantially higher than\nwould be expected in the absence of space and time correlation of risk as is usually tacitly assumed. We also find evidence for the increasing exposure\nto climate-induced risk, and for decadal variability in exposure. The\nrelative vulnerability of different portfolios to multiple extreme events in\na given year is also demonstrated.",
        "Ecologically relevant streamflow characteristics (SFCs) of ungauged\r\ncatchments are often estimated from simulated runoff of hydrologic models\r\nthat were originally calibrated on gauged catchments. However, SFC estimates\r\nof the gauged donor catchments and subsequently the ungauged catchments can\r\nbe substantially uncertain when models are calibrated using traditional\r\napproaches based on optimization of statistical performance metrics (e.g.,\r\nNash–Sutcliffe model efficiency). An improved calibration strategy for\r\ngauged catchments is therefore crucial to help reduce the uncertainties of\r\nestimated SFCs for ungauged catchments. The aim of this study was to improve\r\nSFC estimates from modeled runoff time series in gauged catchments by\r\nexplicitly including one or several SFCs in the calibration process.\r\nDifferent types of objective functions were defined consisting of the\r\nNash–Sutcliffe model efficiency, single SFCs, or combinations thereof. We\r\ncalibrated a bucket-type runoff model (HBV – Hydrologiska Byråns\r\nVattenavdelning – model) for 25 catchments in the Tennessee River basin and\r\nevaluated the proposed calibration approach on 13 ecologically relevant SFCs\r\nrepresenting major flow regime components and different flow conditions.\r\nWhile the model generally tended to underestimate the tested SFCs related to\r\nmean and high-flow conditions, SFCs related to low flow were generally\r\noverestimated. The highest estimation accuracies were achieved by a\r\nSFC-specific model calibration. Estimates of SFCs not included in the\r\ncalibration process were of similar quality when comparing a multi-SFC\r\ncalibration approach to a traditional model efficiency calibration. For\r\npractical applications, this implies that SFCs should preferably be estimated\r\nfrom targeted runoff model calibration, and modeled estimates need to be\r\ncarefully interpreted.",
        "ERA-Interim/Land is a global land surface reanalysis data set covering the\nperiod 1979–2010. It describes the evolution of soil moisture, soil\ntemperature and snowpack.

        "This study examines the temporal variation of the seismicity in the \nVal d'Agri (southern Italy) and adjacent areas, for the current seismic hazard\nevaluation. The temporal variation of the seismicity is expressed as time\nseries of the number of earthquakes, <i>b</i> value of Gutenberg–Richter\nrelationship or <i>b</i> value of the frequency–magnitude distribution and the\nseismic energy released in the form of log<i>E</i><sup>2/3</sup>.

        "Interactions between humans and the environment are occurring on a scale that\nhas never previously been seen; the scale of human interaction with the water\ncycle, along with the coupling present between social and hydrological\nsystems, means that decisions that impact water also impact people. Models\nare often used to assist in decision-making regarding hydrological systems,\nand so in order for effective decisions to be made regarding water resource\nmanagement, these interactions and feedbacks should be accounted for in\nmodels used to analyse systems in which water and humans interact. This paper\nreviews literature surrounding aspects of socio-hydrological modelling. It\nbegins with background information regarding the current state of\nsocio-hydrology as a discipline, before covering reasons for modelling and\npotential applications. Some important concepts that underlie\nsocio-hydrological modelling efforts are then discussed, including ways of\nviewing socio-hydrological systems, space and time in modelling, complexity,\ndata and model conceptualisation. Several modelling approaches are described,\nthe stages in their development detailed and their applicability to\nsocio-hydrological cases discussed. Gaps in research are then highlighted to\nguide directions for future research. The review of literature suggests that\nthe nature of socio-hydrological study, being interdisciplinary, focusing on\ncomplex interactions between human and natural systems, and dealing with long\nhorizons, is such that modelling will always present a challenge; it is,\nhowever, the task of the modeller to use the wide range of tools afforded to\nthem to overcome these challenges as much as possible. The focus in\nsocio-hydrology is on understanding the human–water system in a holistic\nsense, which differs from the problem solving focus of other water management\nfields, and as such models in socio-hydrology should be developed with a view\nto gaining new insight into these dynamics. There is an essential choice that\nsocio-hydrological modellers face in deciding between representing individual\nsystem processes or viewing the system from a more abstracted level and\nmodelling it as such; using these different approaches has implications for\nmodel development, applicability and the insight that they are capable of\ngiving, and so the decision regarding how to model the system requires\nthorough consideration of, among other things, the nature of understanding\nthat is sought.",
        "Charcoal has long been known by the community in its use either as energy sources or for agriculture/forestry-related aspects.  Beginning from the discovery of the so-called Terra Preta, the role of charcoal in improving soil fertility and enhancing its productivity at agriculture as well as forestry lands has attracted remarkable attention internationally ever since.  Raw material for charcoal can be wood or other ligno-cellulosic stuffs (e.g. coconut shells, oil-palm shells, rice husks, wood sawdust, nut shells, etc).  Technology in charcoal manufacture commonly employed by the community comprises heaping-kiln, drum kiln, and dome-shaped kiln systems.  Such manufacture technology is simply carbonizing the ligno-cellulosic stuffs inside the kiln into charcoal.  The charcoal yield usually ranges about 20-25% (w/w), implying that as much 75-80% of the stuffs is lost as smoke that further escape to the air.  Environment concerns arise since such escaped smoke can pollute the atmosphere and hence contribute to the global warming.  Measures are urgently needed to reduce the amount of such escapes among others, as developed by the Center for Research and Development on Forestry Engineering and Forest Products Processing (CRDFEFPP, Indonesia) by cooling the smoke, during the carbonization of ligno-cellulosic stuffs, thereby condensing it into liquid smoke (popularly called as wood vinegar). Through intensive and tedious researches, it is found out that the wood vinegar (as charcoal by-product) could effectively function as bio-pesticides and bio-fertilizers.  Meanwhile, application of charcoal to the seedlings of forestry plant species reveals positive responses as shown by the increase in biomass weight of those plants on other positive plant-growth aspects (e.g. stem height and diameter).  Likewise, the use of charcoal combined with compost (i.e. organic fertilizer that results from bio-conversion of biomass stuffs) could enhance as much 2-3 times the production of vegetables plants as the control (untreated plants).  This in all strongly indicates the charcoal and wood-vinegar manufacture entirely called as essentially the bio-char technology, can convert biomass stuffs (previously regarded as not or less useful) into value-added or more useful products (charcoal and wood vinegar).",
        "In order to develop (renewal and extension) the Liberoid coffee in peatland, it is necessary to do the program of increasing production and quality of Liberoid coffee. It requires the superior planting materials of superior in specific location. This study has the objective to find out the performance of the selected main trees of Liberoid coffee. The study was conducted from January to September 2015 in the area of peatland in the Kedaburapat village, Rangsang Pesisir District, Kepulauan Meranti Regency, Riau. The method used was the direct observation of main trees of selected Liberoid coffee. The observed character is quantitative and qualitative character. The results showed the diversity of quantitative characters within a range between 7.39 to 40.11%. The average number of pieces / bunch is third with a production of 30.63 kg / tree / year, 288.25 cm plant height, stem diameter 36.88 cm, the number of primary branches of 5.88; the number of secondary branches 12.63, crown width 185.88 cm western, eastern 201.13 cm, 209.25 cm southern and northern 216.75 cm. The diversity of qualitative character is seen in the character of shoot color, old fruit color, fruit shape, fruit discuss, and the upper surface of the leaf.",
        "Groundwater is the world's largest accessible source of fresh water. It plays\na vital role in satisfying basic needs for drinking water, agriculture and\nindustrial activities. During times of drought groundwater sustains baseflow\nto rivers and wetlands, thereby supporting ecosystems. Most global-scale\nhydrological models (GHMs) do not include a groundwater flow component,\nmainly due to lack of geohydrological data at the global scale. For the\nsimulation of lateral flow and groundwater head dynamics, a realistic\nphysical representation of the groundwater system is needed, especially for\nGHMs that run at finer resolutions. In this study we present a global-scale\ngroundwater model (run at 6' resolution) using MODFLOW to construct an\nequilibrium water table at its natural state as the result of long-term\nclimatic forcing. The used aquifer schematization and properties are based on\navailable global data sets of lithology and transmissivities combined with the\nestimated thickness of an upper, unconfined aquifer. This model is forced\nwith outputs from the land-surface PCRaster Global Water Balance (PCR-GLOBWB) model, specifically net\nrecharge and surface water levels. A sensitivity analysis, in which the model\nwas run with various parameter settings, showed that variation in saturated\nconductivity has the largest impact on the groundwater levels simulated.\nValidation with observed groundwater heads showed that groundwater heads are\nreasonably well simulated for many regions of the world, especially for\nsediment basins (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.95). The simulated regional-scale\ngroundwater patterns and flow paths demonstrate the relevance of lateral\ngroundwater flow in GHMs. Inter-basin groundwater flows can be a significant\npart of a basin's water budget and help to sustain river baseflows,\nespecially during droughts. Also, water availability of larger aquifer\nsystems can be positively affected by additional recharge from inter-basin\ngroundwater flows.",
        "Statistical models of the relationship between precipitation and topography\nare key elements for the spatial interpolation of rain-gauge measurements in\nhigh-mountain regions. This study investigates several extensions of the\nclassical precipitation–height model in a direct comparison and within two\npopular interpolation frameworks, namely linear regression and kriging with\nexternal drift. The models studied include predictors of topographic height\nand slope at several spatial scales, a stratification by types\nof a circulation classification, and a predictor for wind-aligned\ntopographic gradients. The benefit of the modeling components is\ninvestigated for the interpolation of seasonal mean and daily precipitation\nusing leave-one-out cross-validation. The study domain is a north–south\ncross section of the European Alps (154 km × 187 km) that is inclined towards \ndense rain-gauge measurements (approx. 440 stations, 1971–2008).\n<br><br>\nThe significance of the topographic predictors was found to strongly depend\non the interpolation framework. In linear regression, predictors of slope\nand at multiple scales reduce interpolation errors substantially. But with\nas many as nine predictors, the resulting interpolation still poorly\nreplicates the across-ridge variation of climatological mean precipitation.\nKriging with external drift (KED) leads to much smaller interpolation errors\nthan linear regression, but this is achieved with a single predictor (local\ntopographic height), whereas the incorporation of more extended\npredictor sets brings only marginal further improvement. Furthermore, the\nstratification by circulation types and the wind-aligned gradient predictor\ndo not improve over the single predictor KED model. As for daily\nprecipitation, interpolation accuracy improves considerably with KED and\nthe use of a single predictor field (the distribution of seasonal mean\nprecipitation) as compared to ordinary kriging (i.e., without any predictor). \nNonetheless, information from circulation types did not improve\ninterpolation accuracy.\n<br><br>\nOur results confirm that the consideration of topography effects is\nimportant for spatial interpolation of precipitation in high-mountain\nregions. But a single predictor may be sufficient and taking appropriate\naccount of the spatial autocorrelation (by kriging) can be more effective\nthan the development of elaborate predictor sets within a regression model.\nOur results also question a popular practice of using linear regression for\npredictor selection in spatial interpolation; however they support the common\npractice of using a climatological mean field as a background in the\ninterpolation of daily precipitation.",
        "Several remote sensing techniques, namely traditional\r\naerial photographs, an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), and airborne lidar,\r\nwere used in this study to decipher the morphological features of obscure\r\nlandslides in volcanic regions and how the observed features may be used for\r\nunderstanding landslide occurrence and potential hazard. A morphological\r\nreconstruction method was proposed to assess landslide morphology based on\r\nthe dome-shaped topography of the volcanic edifice and the nature of its\r\nmorphological evolution. Two large-scale landslides in the Tatun volcano\r\ngroup in northern Taiwan were targeted to more accurately characterize the\r\nlandslide morphology through airborne lidar and UAS-derived digital terrain\r\nmodels and images. With the proposed reconstruction method, the depleted\r\nvolume of the two landslides was estimated to be at least\r\n820 ± 20  ×  10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup>. Normal faulting in the region\r\nlikely played a role in triggering the two landslides, because there are\r\nextensive geological and historical records of an active normal fault in this\r\nregion. The subsequent geomorphological evolution of the two landslides is\r\nthus inferred to account for the observed morphological and tectonic features\r\nthat are indicative of resulting in large and life-threatening landslides, as\r\ncharacterized using the recent remote sensing techniques.",
        "Climate change and land use are rapidly changing the amount and temporal\ndistribution of recharge in northern aquifers. This paper presents a novel\nmethod for distributing Monte Carlo simulations of 1-D sandy sediment\nprofile spatially to estimate transient recharge in an unconfined esker\naquifer. The modelling approach uses data-based estimates for the most\nimportant parameters controlling the total amount (canopy cover) and timing\n(thickness of the unsaturated zone) of groundwater recharge. Scots pine\ncanopy was parameterized to leaf area index (LAI) using forestry inventory\ndata. Uncertainty in the parameters controlling sediment hydraulic\nproperties and evapotranspiration (ET) was carried over from the Monte Carlo runs\nto the final recharge estimates. Different mechanisms for lake, soil, and\nsnow evaporation and transpiration were used in the model set-up. Finally,\nthe model output was validated with independent recharge estimates using the\nwater table fluctuation (WTF) method and baseflow estimation. The results\nindicated that LAI is important in controlling total recharge amount. Soil\nevaporation (SE) compensated for transpiration for areas with low LAI values,\nwhich may be significant in optimal management of forestry and recharge.\nDifferent forest management scenarios tested with the model showed\ndifferences in annual recharge of up to 100 mm. The uncertainty in recharge\nestimates arising from the simulation parameters was lower than the\ninterannual variation caused by climate conditions. It proved important to\ntake unsaturated thickness and vegetation cover into account when estimating\nspatially and temporally distributed recharge in sandy unconfined aquifers.",
        "As a tool for addressing problems of scale, we consider an evolving approach\nknown as the thermodynamically constrained averaging theory (TCAT), which has\nbroad applicability to hydrology. We consider the case of modeling of two-fluid-phase flow in porous media, and we focus on issues of scale as they\nrelate to various measures of pressure, capillary pressure, and state\nequations needed to produce solvable models. We apply TCAT to perform\nphysics-based data assimilation to understand how the internal behavior\ninfluences the macroscale state of two-fluid porous medium systems. A\nmicrofluidic experimental method and a lattice Boltzmann simulation method\nare used to examine a key deficiency associated with standard approaches. In\na hydrologic process such as evaporation, the water content will ultimately\nbe reduced below the irreducible wetting-phase saturation\ndetermined from experiments. This is problematic since the derived closure\nrelationships cannot predict the associated capillary pressures for these\nstates. We demonstrate that the irreducible wetting-phase saturation is an\nartifact of the experimental design, caused by the fact that the boundary\npressure difference does not approximate the true capillary pressure. Using\naveraging methods, we compute the true capillary pressure for fluid\nconfigurations at and below the irreducible wetting-phase saturation. Results\nof our analysis include a state function for the capillary pressure expressed\nas a function of fluid saturation and interfacial area.",
        "Artificial recharge of aquifers is a technique for improving water quality\r\nand increasing groundwater resources. Understanding the fate of a potential\r\ncontaminant requires knowledge of the residence time distribution (RTD) of\r\nthe recharged water in the aquifer beneath. A simple way to obtain the RTDs\r\nis to perform a tracer test. We performed a pulse injection tracer test in an\r\nartificial recharge system through an infiltration basin to obtain the\r\nbreakthrough curves, which directly yield the RTDs. The RTDs turned out to be\r\nvery broad and we used a numerical model to interpret them, to characterize\r\nheterogeneity, and to extend the model to other flow conditions. The model\r\ncomprised nine layers at the site scaled to emulate the layering of aquifer\r\ndeposits. Two types of hypotheses were considered: homogeneous (all flow and\r\ntransport parameters identical for every layer) and heterogeneous (diverse\r\nparameters for each layer). The parameters were calibrated against the head\r\nand concentration data in both model types, which were validated quite\r\nsatisfactorily against 1,1,2-Trichloroethane and electrical conductivity data\r\ncollected over a long period of time with highly varying flow conditions. We\r\nfound that the broad RTDs can be attributed to the complex flow structure\r\ngenerated under the basin due to three-dimensionality and time fluctuations\r\n(the homogeneous model produced broad RTDs) and the heterogeneity of the\r\nmedia (the heterogeneous model yielded much better fits). We conclude that\r\nheterogeneity must be acknowledged to properly assess mixing and broad RTDs,\r\nwhich are required to explain the water quality improvement of artificial\r\nrecharge basins.",
        "Soil moisture dynamics reflect the complex interactions of meteorological\nconditions with soil, vegetation and terrain properties. In this study,\nintermediate-scale soil moisture estimates from the cosmic-ray neutron\nsensing (CRNS) method are evaluated for two semiarid ecosystems in the\nsouthwestern United States: a mesquite savanna at the Santa Rita\nExperimental Range (SRER) and a mixed shrubland at the Jornada Experimental\nRange (JER). Evaluations of the CRNS method are performed for small\nwatersheds instrumented with a distributed sensor network consisting of soil\nmoisture sensor profiles, an eddy covariance tower, and runoff flumes used to\nclose the water balance. We found a very good agreement between the CRNS\nmethod and the distributed sensor network (root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.009 and 0.013 m<sup>3</sup> m<sup>−3</sup> at SRER and JER, respectively) at the hourly timescale over the 19-month\nstudy period, primarily due to the inclusion of 5 cm observations of shallow\nsoil moisture. Good agreement was also obtained in soil moisture changes\nestimated from the CRNS and watershed water balance methods (RMSE of 0.001\nand 0.082 m<sup>3</sup> m<sup>−3</sup> at SRER and JER, respectively), with deviations due to bypassing\nof the CRNS measurement depth during large rainfall events. Once validated,\nthe CRNS soil moisture estimates were used to investigate hydrological\nprocesses at the footprint scale at each site. Through the computation of\nthe water balance, we showed that drier-than-average conditions at SRER\npromoted plant water uptake from deeper soil layers, while the\nwetter-than-average period at JER resulted in percolation towards deeper\nsoils. The CRNS measurements were then used to quantify the link between\nevapotranspiration and soil moisture at a commensurate scale, finding\nsimilar predictive relations at both sites that are applicable to other\nsemiarid ecosystems in the southwestern US.</p>",
        "A stable isotope study of 67 kettle lakes and ponds situated on an esker\naquifer (90 km<sup>2</sup>) in northern Finland was carried out to determine the\nrole and extent of groundwater inflow in groundwater-dependent lakes.\nDistinct seasonal fluctuations in the δ<sup>18</sup>O and δ<sup>2</sup>H\nvalues of lakes are the result of seasonal ice cover prohibiting evaporation\nduring the winter. An iterative isotope mass balance approach was used to\ncalculate the inflow-to-evaporation ratios (<i>I</i><sub>TOT</sub>/<i>E</i>) of all 67 lakes\nduring the summer of 2013 when the isotopic compositions of the lakes were\napproaching a steady-state. The balance calculations were carried out\nindependently for <sup>2</sup>H and <sup>18</sup>O data. Since evaporation rates were\nderived independently of any mass balance considerations, it was possible to\ndetermine the total inflow (<i>I</i><sub>TOT</sub>) and mean turnover time (MTT) of the\nlakes. Furthermore, the groundwater seepage rates to all studied lakes were\ncalculated. A quantitative measure was introduced for the dependence of a\nlake on groundwater (<i>G</i> index) that is defined as the percentage contribution\nof groundwater inflow to the total inflow of water to the given lake. The <i>G</i> index\nvalues of the lakes studied ranged from ca. 39 to 98%,\nrevealing generally large groundwater dependency among the studied lakes.\nThis study shows the effectiveness of applying an isotope mass balance\napproach to quantify the groundwater reliance of lakes situated in a\nrelatively small area with similar climatic conditions.",
        "The atmospheric wind stress forcing and the oceanic response are examined\nfor the period between 15 September 2008 and 6 October 2008, during which\ntwo typhoons – Hagupit and Jangmi – passed through the same region of the\nwestern Pacific at Saffir–Simpson intensity categories one and three,\nrespectively. A three-dimensional oceanic mixed layer model is compared\nagainst the remote sensing observations as well as high-repetition Argo\nfloat data. Numerical model simulations suggested that magnitude of the\ncooling caused by the second typhoon, Jangmi, would have been significantly\nlarger if the ocean had not already been influenced by the first typhoon,\nHagupit. It is estimated that the temperature anomaly behind Jangmi would\nhave been about 0.4 °C larger in both cold wake and left side of\nthe track. The numerical simulations suggest that the magnitude and position\nof Jangmi's cold wake depends on the precursor state of the ocean as well as\nlag between typhoons. Based on sensitivity experiments we show that\ntemperature anomaly difference between \"single typhoon\" and \"two\ntyphoons\"\nas well as magnitude of the cooling strongly depends on the distance between\nthem. The amount of kinetic energy and coupling with inertial oscillations\nare important factors for determining magnitude of the temperature anomaly\nbehind moving typhoons. This paper indicates that studies of\nocean–atmosphere tropical cyclone interaction will benefit from denser, high-repetition Argo float measurements.",

The safety of the lives and property of local people is threatened\nby DFs. A physics-based early warning system (EWS) for DF forecasting was\ndeveloped and applied in this earthquake area. This paper introduces an\napplication of the system in the Wenchuan earthquake-affected area and\nanalyzes the prediction results via a comparison to the DF events triggered\nby the strong rainfall events reported by the local government. The\nprediction accuracy and efficiency was first compared with a\ncontribution-factor-based system currently used by the weather bureau of\nSichuan province. The storm on 17 August 2012 was used as a case study for\nthis comparison. The comparison shows that the false negative rate and false\npositive rate of the new system is, respectively, 19 and 21 % lower than\nthe system based on the contribution factors. Consequently, the prediction\naccuracy is obviously higher than the system based on the contribution\nfactors with a higher operational efficiency. On the invitation of the\nweather bureau of Sichuan province, the authors upgraded their prediction\nsystem of DF by using this new system before the monsoon of Wenchuan\nearthquake-affected area in 2013. Two prediction cases on 9 July 2013 and\n10 July 2014 were chosen to further demonstrate that the\nnew EWS has high stability, efficiency, and prediction accuracy.",

The performance of each GCM in reproducing the\nprecipitation and temperature statistics was ranked and better performing\nGCMs identified for later analyses. Observed global land surface\nprecipitation and temperature data were drawn from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) 3.10 gridded\ndata set and re-sampled to the resolution of each GCM for comparison.\nObserved and GCM-based estimates of mean and standard deviation of annual\nprecipitation, mean annual temperature, mean monthly precipitation and\ntemperature and Köppen–Geiger climate type were compared. The main\nmetrics for assessing GCM performance were the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency\n(NSE) index and root mean square error (RMSE) between modelled and observed long-term statistics.

        "In this research, a dual-inexact fuzzy stochastic programming (DIFSP) method\nwas developed for supporting the planning of water and farmland use\nmanagement system considering the non-point source pollution mitigation under\nuncertainty. The random boundary interval (RBI) was incorporated into DIFSP\nthrough integrating fuzzy linear programming (FLP) and chance-constrained\nprogramming (CCP) approaches within an interval linear programming (ILP)\nframework. This developed method could effectively tackle the uncertainties\nexpressed as intervals and fuzzy sets. Moreover, the lower and upper bounds\nof RBI are continuous random variables, and the correlation existing between\nthe lower and upper bounds can be tackled in RBI through the joint\nprobability distribution function.

        "Accurate specification of the model error covariances in data assimilation systems is a\r\nchallenging issue. Ensemble land data assimilation methods rely on stochastic perturbations of input\r\nforcing and model prognostic fields for developing representations of input model error covariances.\r\nThis article examines the limitations of using a single forcing dataset for specifying forcing uncertainty\r\ninputs for assimilating snow depth retrievals. Using an idealized data assimilation experiment,\r\nthe article demonstrates that the use of hybrid forcing input strategies\r\n(either through the use of an ensemble of forcing products or through the\r\nadded use of the forcing climatology) provide a better characterization of\r\nthe background model error, which leads to improved data assimilation\r\nresults, especially during the snow accumulation and melt-time periods. The\r\nuse of hybrid forcing ensembles is then employed for assimilating snow depth\r\nretrievals from the AMSR2 instrument over two domains in the continental USA\r\nwith different snow evolution characteristics. Over a region near the Great\r\nLakes, where the snow evolution tends to be ephemeral, the use of hybrid\r\nforcing ensembles provides significant improvements relative to the use of a\r\nsingle forcing dataset. Over the Colorado headwaters characterized by large\r\nsnow accumulation, the impact of using the forcing ensemble is less prominent\r\nand is largely limited to the snow transition time periods.

        "Water scarcity conditions over the 21st century both globally and regionally\nare assessed in the context of climate change and climate mitigation\npolicies, by estimating both water availability and water demand within the\nGlobal Change Assessment Model (GCAM), a leading community-integrated\nassessment model of energy, agriculture, climate, and water. To quantify\nchanges in future water availability, a new gridded water-balance global\nhydrologic model – namely, the Global Water Availability Model (GWAM) – is\ndeveloped and evaluated. Global water demands for six major demand sectors\n(irrigation, livestock, domestic, electricity generation, primary energy\nproduction, and manufacturing) are modeled in GCAM at the regional scale (14\ngeopolitical regions, 151 sub-regions) and then spatially downscaled to\n0.5° × 0.5° resolution to match the scale of GWAM.\nUsing a baseline scenario (i.e., no climate change mitigation policy) with\nradiative forcing reaching 8.8 W m<sup>−2</sup> (equivalent to the SRES A1Fi\nemission scenario) and three climate policy scenarios with increasing\nmitigation stringency of 7.7, 5.5, and 4.2 W m<sup>−2</sup> (equivalent to the\nSRES A2, B2, and B1 emission scenarios, respectively), we investigate the\neffects of emission mitigation policies on water scarcity. Two carbon tax\nregimes (a universal carbon tax (UCT) which includes land use change\nemissions, and a fossil fuel and industrial emissions carbon tax (FFICT)\nwhich excludes land use change emissions) are analyzed. The baseline scenario\nresults in more than half of the world population living under extreme water\nscarcity by the end of the 21st century.

When comparing the climate\npolicy scenarios to the baseline scenario while maintaining the same baseline\nsocioeconomic assumptions, water scarcity declines under a UCT mitigation\npolicy but increases with a FFICT mitigation scenario by the year 2095,\nparticularly with more stringent climate mitigation targets. Under the FFICT\nscenario, water scarcity is projected to increase, driven by higher water\ndemands for bio-energy crops.",
        "Investment development for oil palm plantation in Indonesia was increasing and it clear away into peat land area. Land clearing activities without considering peat ecological function may have impact on environmental degradation. The objective of this research was to study development potential of oil palm plantation at peat land by using land evaluation approach. The field survey method was observation scale and land suitability assessment was based on FAO standard with adjustment. Assessment results showed that land had peat thickness higher than 3 m covering 28% of total area so that it can be opened for oil palm plantation. The main constraint factors for the clearing of feasible area were soil reaction, flooding condition and nutrients status. These parameters could be potentially improved. However, final assessment of land showed that it was classified as less feasible (S2) due to relatively high investment.  Cultivation can only be conducted with provision of drainage facility. Caution should be taken in designing open channel in order to prevent excessive water drainage. Therefore, hydrologic analysis can be based on 5 years return period only. Computer simulation of DRAINMOD was applied to determine the operational effect of control structures in elevating of water table during dry season. Simulation results showed that during the opening operation of open channel without control structures at dry season, water table was dropped up to 90 cm below soil surface. Water retention effort in tertiary channel at 70 cm level could elevated water up to 30-40 cm below soil surface. The key success for oil palm plantation development at peat land was highly depended on availability of control structure at tertiary channel. Flap water gate type from fibre material was very suitable for field application. Retention system by using soil sack or stoplog water gate could be implemented at initial stage in order to economize the cost.",

Here, we hypothesize that storm surge events\n  are caused by high wind speeds from north-westerly\n  direction in combination with a large-scale wind storm event\n  affecting the North Sea region.  The method is calibrated for ERA-40\n  data, using the data from the storm surge atlas for Cuxhaven. It is\n  shown that using information of both wind speed and direction as\n  well as large-scale wind storm events improves the identification of\n  storm surge events.\n<br><br>\n  To estimate possible future changes of potential storm surge events,\n  we apply the new identification approach to an ensemble of three transient climate\n  change simulations performed with the ECHAM5/MPIOM model\n  under A1B greenhouse gas scenario forcing. We find an\n  increase in the total number of potential storm surge events of about\n  12 % [(2001–2100)–(1901–2000)], mainly based on changes of moderate events. Yearly numbers of\n  storm surge relevant events show high interannual and decadal\n  variability and only one of three simulations shows\n  a statistical significant increase in the yearly number of potential storm\n  surge events between 1900 and 2100. However, no changes in\n  the maximum intensity and duration of all potential events is determined.\n  Extreme value statistic analysis confirms no frequency change of the most severe events.",
        "As an extreme scenario of dynamical sea level changes,\nregional sea surface height (SSH) changes that occur in the North Atlantic due\nto an abrupt weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation\n(AMOC) are simulated. Two versions of the same ocean-only model are used to study\nthe effect of ocean model resolution on these SSH changes: a high-resolution\n(HR) strongly eddying version and a low-resolution (LR) version in which the\neffect of eddies is parameterised. The weakening of the AMOC is induced\nin both model versions by applying strong freshwater perturbations around\nGreenland. A rapid decrease of the AMOC in the HR version\ninduces much shorter return times of several specific regional and coastal\nextremes in North Atlantic SSH than in the LR version. This effect is\ncaused by a change in main eddy pathways associated with a change in\nseparation latitude of the Gulf Stream.",
        "Initial conditions for flows and depths (cross-sectional\r\nareas) throughout a river network are required for any time-marching\r\n(unsteady) solution of the one-dimensional (1-D) hydrodynamic Saint-Venant\r\nequations. For a river network modeled with several Strahler orders of\r\ntributaries, comprehensive and consistent synoptic data are typically lacking\r\nand synthetic starting conditions are needed. Because of underlying\r\nnonlinearity, poorly defined or inconsistent initial conditions can lead to\r\nconvergence problems and long spin-up times in an unsteady solver. Two new\r\napproaches are defined and demonstrated herein for computing flows and\r\ncross-sectional areas (or depths). These methods can produce an initial\r\ncondition data set that is consistent with modeled landscape runoff and river\r\ngeometry boundary conditions at the initial time. These new methods are\r\n(1) the pseudo time-marching method (PTM) that iterates toward a steady-state\r\ninitial condition using an unsteady Saint-Venant solver and (2) the\r\nsteady-solution method (SSM) that makes use of graph theory for initial flow\r\nrates and solution of a steady-state 1-D momentum equation for the channel\r\ncross-sectional areas. The PTM is shown to be adequate for short river\r\nreaches but is significantly slower and has occasional non-convergent\r\nbehavior for large river networks. The SSM approach is shown to provide a\r\nrapid solution of consistent initial conditions for both small and large\r\nnetworks, albeit with the requirement that additional code must be written\r\nrather than applying an existing unsteady Saint-Venant solver.",
        "Hindcasts based on the extended streamflow prediction (ESP) approach are\ncarried out in a typical rainfall-dominated basin in China, aiming to\nexamine the roles of initial conditions (IC), future atmospheric forcing\n(FC) and hydrologic model uncertainty (MU) in streamflow forecast skill. The\ncombined effects of IC and FC are explored within the framework of a forecast\nwindow. By implementing virtual numerical simulations without the\nconsideration of MU, it is found that the dominance of IC can last up to 90 days\nin the dry season, while its impact gives way to FC for lead times exceeding\n30 days in the wet season. The combined effects of IC and FC on the forecast\nskill are further investigated by proposing a dimensionless parameter\n(<i>β</i>) that represents the ratio of the total amount of initial water\nstorage and the incoming rainfall. The forecast skill increases\nexponentially with <i>β</i>, and varies greatly in different forecast\nwindows. Moreover, the influence of MU on forecast skill is examined by\nfocusing on the uncertainty of model parameters. Two different hydrologic\nmodel calibration strategies are carried out. The results indicate that the uncertainty\nof model parameters exhibits a more significant influence on the forecast\nskill in the dry season than in the wet season. The ESP approach is more\nskillful in monthly streamflow forecast during the transition period from\nwet to dry than otherwise. For the transition period from dry to wet, the\nlow skill of the forecasts could be attributed to the combined effects of\nIC and FC, but less to the biases in the hydrologic model parameters. For the\nforecasts in the dry season, the skill of the ESP approach is heavily\ndependent on the strategy of the model calibration.",
        "In order to evaluate the impact of human activities (mainly dam\nbuilding) on the Changjiang River sediment discharging into the sea, the\nspatial–temporal variations in the sediment load of different tributaries of\nthe river were analyzed to reveal the quantity, grain size and composition\npatterns of the sediment entering the sea. The results show that the timing\nof reduction in the sediment load of the main stream of the Changjiang was\ndifferent from those associated with downstream and upstream sections,\nindicating the influences of the sub-catchments. Four stepwise reduction\nperiods were identified, i.e., 1956–1969, 1970–1985, 1986–2002, and\n2003–2010. The proportion of the sediment load originating from the Jinsha\nRiver continuously increased before 2003; after 2003, channel erosion in the\nmain stream provided a major source of the sediment discharging into the\nsea. In addition, in response to dam construction, although mean grain size\nof the suspended sediment entering the sea did not change greatly with these\ndifferent periods, the inter-annual variability for sediment composition or\nthe relative contributions from the various tributaries changed\nconsiderably. Before 2003, the clay, silt and sand fractions of the river\nload were supplied directly by the upstream parts of the Changjiang; after\n2003, although the clay component may still be originating mainly from the\nupstream areas, the source of the silt and sand components have been shifted\nto a large extent to the river bed erosion of the middle reach of the river.\nThese observations imply that the load, grain size and sediment composition\ndeposited over the coastal and shelf water adjacent to the river mouth may\nhave changed rapidly recently, in response to the catchment changes.",

        "Robust and reliable water-resource mapping in ungauged basins requires\nestimation of the uncertainties in the hydrologic model, the regionalisation\nmethod, and the observational data. In this study we investigated the use of\nregionalised flow-duration curves (FDCs) for constraining model predictive\nuncertainty, while accounting for all these uncertainty sources. A\nwater balance model was applied to 36 basins in Central America using\nregionally and globally available precipitation, climate and discharge data\nthat were screened for inconsistencies. A rating-curve analysis for 35\nHonduran discharge stations was used to estimate discharge uncertainty for\nthe region, and the consistency of the model forcing and evaluation data was\nanalysed using two different screening methods. FDCs with uncertainty bounds\nwere calculated for each basin, accounting for both discharge uncertainty\nand, in many cases, uncertainty stemming from the use of short time series,\npotentially not representative for the modelling period. These uncertain\nFDCs were then used to regionalise a FDC for each basin, treating it as\nungauged in a cross-evaluation, and this regionalised FDC was used to\nconstrain the uncertainty in the model predictions for the basin.\n<br><br>\nThere was a clear relationship between the performance of the local model\ncalibration and the degree of data set consistency – with many basins with\ninconsistent data lacking behavioural simulations (i.e. simulations within\npredefined limits around the observed FDC) and the basins with the highest\ndata set consistency also having the highest simulation reliability. For the\nbasins where the regionalisation of the FDCs worked best, the uncertainty\nbounds for the regionalised simulations were only slightly wider than those\nfor a local model calibration. The predicted uncertainty was greater for\nbasins where the result of the FDC regionalisation was more uncertain, but\nthe regionalised simulations still had a high reliability compared to the\nlocally calibrated simulations and often encompassed them. The regionalised\nFDCs were found to be useful on their own as a basic signature constraint;\nhowever, additional regionalised signatures could further constrain the\nuncertainty in the predictions and may increase the robustness to severe\ndata inconsistencies, which are difficult to detect for ungauged basins.",
        "This paper presents an\nanalysis of the distributions of nonlinear crests, troughs and heights of\ndeep water waves from mixed following sea states generated mechanically in an\noffshore basin and compares with previous results for mixed crossing seas\nfrom the same experiment. The random signals at the wavemaker in both types\nof mixed seas are characterized by bimodal spectra following the model of\nGuedes Soares (1984). In agreement with the Benjamin–Feir mechanism, the\nhigh-frequency spectrum shows a decrease in the peak magnitude and downshift\nof the peak with the distance, as well as reduction of the tail. The observed\nstatistics and probabilistic distributions exhibit, in general, increasing\neffects of third-order nonlinearity with the distance from the wavemaker.\nHowever, this effect is less pronounced in the wave systems with two\nfollowing wave trains than in the crossing seas, given that they have\nidentical initial characteristics of the bimodal spectra. The relevance of\nthird-order effects due to free modes only is demonstrated and assessed by\nexcluding the vertically asymmetric distortions induced by bound wave effects\nof second and third order. The fact that for records characterized by\nrelatively large coefficient of kurtosis, the empirical distributions for the\nnon-skewed profiles continue deviating from the linear predictions,\ncorroborate the relevance of free wave interactions and thus the need of\nusing higher-order models for the description of wave data.",
        "Debris flows and flash floods are often preceded by intense, convective\nrainfall. The establishment of reliable rainfall thresholds is an important\ncomponent for quantitative hazard and risk assessment, and for the\ndevelopment of an early warning system. Traditional empirical thresholds\nbased on peak intensity, duration and antecedent rainfall can be difficult to\nverify due to the localized character of the rainfall and the absence of\nweather radar or sufficiently dense rain gauge networks in mountainous\nregions. However, convective rainfall can be strongly linked to regional\natmospheric patterns and profiles. There is potential to employ this in\nempirical threshold analysis.\n<br><br>\nThis work develops a methodology to determine robust thresholds for flash\nfloods and debris flows utilizing regional atmospheric conditions derived\nfrom ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis data, comparing the results with rain-gauge-derived thresholds. The method includes selecting the appropriate atmospheric\nindicators, categorizing the potential thresholds, determining and testing\nthe thresholds. The method is tested in the Ubaye Valley in the southern\nFrench Alps (548 km<sup>2</sup>), which is known to have localized convection\ntriggered debris flows and flash floods. This paper shows that instability of\nthe atmosphere and specific humidity at 700 hPa are the most important\natmospheric indicators for debris flows and flash floods in the study area.\nFurthermore, this paper demonstrates that atmospheric reanalysis data are an\nimportant asset, and could replace rainfall measurements in empirical\nexceedance thresholds for debris flows and flash floods.",
        "Groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) are at risk globally due to\nunsustainable levels of groundwater extraction, especially in arid and\nsemi-arid regions. In this review, we examine recent developments in the\necohydrology of GDEs with a focus on three knowledge gaps: (1) how do we\nlocate GDEs, (2) how much water is transpired from shallow aquifers by GDEs\nand (3) what are the responses of GDEs to excessive groundwater extraction?\nThe answers to these questions will determine water allocations that are\nrequired to sustain functioning of GDEs and to guide regulations on\ngroundwater extraction to avoid negative impacts on GDEs.\n<br><br>\nWe discuss three methods for identifying GDEs: (1) techniques relying on\nremotely sensed information; (2) fluctuations in depth-to-groundwater that\nare associated with diurnal variations in transpiration; and (3) stable\nisotope analysis of water sources in the transpiration stream.\n<br><br>\nWe then discuss several methods for estimating rates of GW use, including\ndirect measurement using sapflux or eddy covariance technologies, estimation\nof a climate wetness index within a Budyko framework, spatial distribution of\nevapotranspiration (ET) using remote sensing, groundwater modelling and\nstable isotopes. Remote sensing methods often rely on direct measurements to\ncalibrate the relationship between vegetation indices and ET. ET from GDEs is\nalso determined using hydrologic models of varying complexity, from the White\nmethod to fully coupled, variable saturation models. Combinations of methods\nare typically employed to obtain clearer insight into the components of\ngroundwater discharge in GDEs, such as the proportional importance of\ntranspiration versus evaporation (e.g. using stable isotopes) or from\ngroundwater versus rainwater sources.\n<br><br>\nGroundwater extraction can have severe consequences for the structure and\nfunction of GDEs. In the most extreme cases, phreatophytes experience crown\ndieback and death following groundwater drawdown. We provide a brief review\nof two case studies of the impacts of GW extraction and then provide an\necosystem-scale, multiple trait, integrated metric of the impact of\ndifferences in groundwater depth on the structure and function of eucalypt\nforests growing along a natural gradient in depth-to-groundwater.

        "Water temperature is a non-conservative tracer in the environment.\n      Variations in recharge temperature are damped and retarded as water\n      moves through an aquifer due to heat exchange between water and\n      rock. However, within karst aquifers, seasonal and short-term\n      fluctuations in recharge temperature are often transmitted over long\n      distances before they are fully damped. Using analytical solutions and\n      numerical simulations, we develop relationships that describe the\n      effect of flow path properties, flow-through time, recharge\n      characteristics, and water and rock physical properties on the damping\n      and retardation of thermal peaks/troughs in karst conduits. Using\n      these relationships, one can estimate the thermal retardation and\n      damping that would occur under given conditions with a given conduit\n      geometry. Ultimately, these relationships can be used with thermal\n      damping and retardation field data to estimate parameters such as\n      conduit diameter. We also examine sets of numerical simulations where\n      we relax some of the assumptions used to develop these relationships,\n      testing the effects of variable diameter, variable velocity, open\n      channels, and recharge shape on thermal damping and retardation to\n      provide some constraints on uncertainty. Finally, we discuss a multitracer\n      experiment that provides some field confirmation of our relationships. High\n      temporal resolution water temperature data are required to obtain\n      sufficient constraints on the magnitude and timing of thermal peaks\n      and troughs in order to take full advantage of water temperature as\n      a tracer.",
        "Tornadoes have been reported in Greece over recent decades in specific\nsub-geographical areas and have been associated with strong synoptic forcing.\nWhile it has been established that meteorological conditions over Greece are\naffected at various scales by the significant variability of topography, the\nIonian Sea to the west and the Aegean Sea to the east, there is still\nuncertainty regarding topography's importance on tornadic generation and\ndevelopment.\n<br><br>\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the role of topography in significant\ntornadogenesis events that were triggered under strong synoptic scale forcing\nover Greece. Three tornado events that occurred over the last years in Thebes\n(Boeotia, 17 November 2007), Vrastema (Chalkidiki, 12 February 2010) and\nVlychos (Lefkada, 20 September 2011) were selected for numerical experiments.\nThese events were associated with synoptic scale forcing, while their\nintensities were T4–T5 (on the TORRO scale), causing significant damage. The\nsimulations were performed using the non-hydrostatic weather research and\nforecasting model (WRF), initialized by European Centre for Medium-Range\nWeather Forecasts (ECMWF) gridded analyses, with telescoping nested grids\nthat allow for the representation of atmospheric circulations ranging from\nthe synoptic scale down to the mesoscale.

        "Republic of Macedonia is an entity described as cultural mosaic, with strong multiethnic and multi-confessional basis, it is a point where East and West meet, it is well-known for the system of Macedonian salad. But, this society even after 25 year of social transition and 2001 Ohrid Agreement did not achieve to find the way of conclusive peace, stability and social eudemonia. The diversity is issue that from time to time produces turbulences, especially at the line of two main identity groups Macedonians-Christian Orthodox and Albanians-Muslim community.\n\nQuantitative data in this study were obtained on a sample of 219 young adults from Skopje (95 of Macedonian and 17 of Albanian ethnicity) and Tetovo (76 of Albanian and 31 of Macedonian ethnicity), aged from 18 to 35 years (M = 24.85, SD = 3.2). Main research question is that if there exist differences between young Macedonians and Albanians in their ethnic, religious and national identity? The objective of this paper is to give a scientific picture how categories as gender, marriage, family, ethnicity, religion, living place, Balkan, Europe are perceived by the youth, all this in favour of using them in producing affirmative actions, more productive societal policies and constructive society-building. Multiple social identities: their complexity and inclusiveness, the correlation of identity variables with SII and SIC are among issues analyzed in this paper. National dominance was more frequent among Macedonians. Our findings demonstrate that Albanian participants expressed strong social identity, as Albanians and as being Muslims. Only social identity inclusiveness is significantly related to societal and political attitudes, but ethnicity should be taken into consideration when this relationship is explored.",
        "Privatization is considered an initial step toward market economy, restructuring financial and economic sector that enables competition in the economy. Privatization is the most painful process in economy where beside legal establishment and political will, it includes also the aspect of fairness and honesty. Analysis of this process is based on the models and comparisons between Kosovo and countries of central and Eastern Europe, in order to give a clearer picture on the overall process of privatization in Kosovo\n\nMethodology that is used to analyze this issue is based on empirical results and also qualitative interpretation of the models and also on studying particular asset privatization process. A widely discussed case of privatization in Kosovo is that of Post and Telecom of Kosovo (PTK). Since each company has its own value, I have focused my appraising analysis on the financial statements with a special observation on Cash Flow from Operation, as the most significant indicator on showing how company is using her physical and human recourses to generate money. I have based my research on using methodology of discounted cash flow from operation analysis, even though the company valuation was done using net cash flow from operation analysis. Cash Flow valuation then was discounted by the T-bonds interest rate.\n\nThis paper tries to bring a conclusion that privatization process in Kosovo have not brought the results excepted, firstly by setting an inappropriate price of assets and lastly by restructuring overall privatization sector and the overall industry. Kosovo, consequently, lost a big opportunity to create a competitive environment of financial industry: starting from the banking industry followed the pension trust which remained at their initial steps of development",

        "The advertisement is a form of marketing communication which is used to encourage, convince or manipulate an audience (the viewers, listeners or readers, sometimes a special group) to take or to continue taking some actions. Advertisements have an important role in increasing sales. Successful ads that result with the growth of sales require competent personnel including a number of specialists; therefore it is very necessary to choose the personnel carefully, to ensure firms a stable position in the market. Advertisement costs are quite large, but they have to be in accordance with the growth of sales. From the collected and analyzed data, we can conclude that kosovar businesses pay great attention to advertisements and share their budget for them. In this paper, the importance of advertisements in sales growth is explained, as well as how many ads do they do, how much budget do they share for this, for which kinds of media do they share more budget and what obstacles they encounter during the advertising. The paper consists of two parts: the part of literature review that is connected to the topic and the research part.

        "The Jazz Singer (1927), a film based on Samson Raphaelson’s short story, “The Day of Atonement,” published in 1922, and inspired by the life of one of the most successful twentieth century Jewish actors, Al Jolson, played an important role in the film industry, as it anticipated the end of the silent film era, and it also managed to offer a closer look at the atmosphere of the Jewish American life, illustrating the main issues that the Jewish American families had to deal with at the beginning of the twentieth century. Later on, three more films were made, and they adapted the original story to the realities of the periods when they were shot, the 1950s, and the 1980s, respectively. The aim of this paper is to highlight the way in which the film industry addressed intergenerational dynamics in Jewish American families during the 1920s and the 1980s, respectively, by comparing and analyzing the original Jazz Singer (1927) and its 1980 remake, with respect to the arising conflict between tradition and ambition, to identity issues, and to the relations established between family members, in conversation with critical sources by Vincent Brook, Joel Rosenberg, and Stephen Whitfield.

The article focuses on the short period in the 1970s during which American executions were halted by the Supreme Court, while France was still putting prisoners to death in cases that were widely debated in public opinion. By observing the French media’s reactions to the two major decisions taken by the Supreme Court in the 1970s and their direct consequences, this essay analyzes not only the French gaze on American practices but also how these American decisions were manipulated by the journalists to stoke the French debate about abolition.",

Such taxonomies are very helpful because they enable us to assess individual bodies of work as well as to place texts within the context of an ongoing literary story.   What makes literature indisp...",
        "In the early 1990s, introducing the Journal of American History’s internationalization project, Maurizio Vaudagna urged his Italian colleagues and all “non-English-speaking American historians in Europe […] to abandon the melancholic but somewhat comfortable situation of being marginal in both worlds.” More than a decade later, now that studying American history has been enormously complicated by the seismic changes connected with the end of the Cold War, the tragedy of 9/11, and the attendan...",
        "This article seeks to contribute to a discussion of pragmatism’s political impulses. It concentrates on the hitherto somewhat neglected question of pragmatism and race. In order to elucidate one possibility of approaching this complex question, the article discusses James Baldwin’s essays. It is argued that Baldwin’s essays can be used to show the significance of a middle ground between Cornel West’s prophetic pragmatism and Richard Rorty’s liberal version of neopragmatism. While the first part analyzes West’s prophetic and worldly pragmatism, the second part seeks to illuminate Rorty’s notion of a pragmatist literary or poeticized culture. The final part demonstrates that while it would be pointless to claim that Baldwin is a radically postmetaphysical author and thus an ideal member of a literary culture, his politicized version of self-creation makes it seem legitimate to advance the argument that he is part of a left-liberal tradition of worldly pragmatism that sees the work of the strong poet or creative redescriber as contributing to political and social change.",

        "This article analyzes Don DeLillo’s narrative in terms of the artistic ethics built into it in connection to the ongoing debate on whether postmodernist as a cultural movement is able to work as a tool for critique in capitalist societies. I will take Mao II (1991) as a representative example of the narrative pattern of a writer’s resistance to the established order, a stance that is continuous throughout DeLillo’s work. I will argue that the articulation of an artistic ethics within his novels replicates his often quoted statement that “the writer is the person who stands outside society, independent of affiliation and independent of influence.” Moreover, I will claim that the insistence with which this artistic ethics appears in DeLillo’s work can be related to the growing difficulties to classify it as postmodernist.",

        "In A Flag for Sunrise, American novelist Robert Stoneexplores the metaphysics of empire, attempting to understand what fears, desires, and ontological conditions impel imperialism. Beneath the stories our leaders tell us to justify interventionism, Stone contends, dwell deep - seated, but over - indulged fears that have twisted many into vicious empire - builders and seekers - after - death. Fear eats away at the self: fear of death, fear of the void within, fear of human meaninglessness, fear of groundlessness in a Godless universe impel the agents of empire forward. Charges into the third world arise from these intertwining fears, from the ache within that can only be briefly quieted through acts of brutality, appropriation, conquest. Imperialism, he suggests, grows from a need to fill this void within, or at least to shut one=s eyes to it through ferocious activities and desires.",

It explores the ways in which such conventions as crosscutting and suspense, the victim-hero of the thriller, or the trope of self-assertion through escape from the social space both articulate the New Individualism discourse and are transformed under its influence.",

The author is looking for similarities in the reworking of interpretations of war photography after the war and discovers that the photographs in conjunction with their editing can be made to cover up as much as they reveal. The Photographic History of the Civil War, published at the height of the Jim Crow era, with its hugely elaborate editorial structure, manages to deny the importance of slavery to the war and the importance of freed slaves afterwards. Even photographs of the dead of Gettysburg take on a meaning more appropriate to 1912 than to the event that produced them. The comparatively direct A Photographic History of the First World War, manages loyalty only to the thought of the author at the moment of its publication. Other interpretations were possible at other times as the author editor followed literary fashion and history.",

        "This article argues that Cormac McCarthy’s latest novel, The Road (2006), marks a clear departure from the interests and aesthetics he showed in his earlier works of fiction. Apart from the fact that the Rhode Island-born writer embarks for a first time in his long career on a popular sci-fi sub-genre such as the post-apocalyptic novel, the book exhibits a number of thematic, structural, and stylistic patterns which differ quite radically from those found in his earlier novels. Most likely influenced by some recent events that have deeply shaken the country and others affecting his personal life, McCarthy can be seen to abandon the landscapes and vernacular rhythms that had become the staple of his artistic performance. By comparing The Road to some of his earlier fiction, the article attempts to establish where those elements of discontinuity become most apparent. In spite of his deadpan naturalism and rather laconic language use, the author manages to keep his readers on their toes thanks to the novel’s much accomplished suspense concerning the fate of the two protagonists. The denouement of the story also strikes those familiar with his fiction as unusual. Still, the second half of the article reveals that, despite all these departures from his previous aesthetics and philosophical wanderings, there are also a number of elements in The Road that speak of his commitment to some values and myths that have contributed to his reputation and fame.",

Du Bois’s views on artistic expression were an organic part of his program to build a black public image for political purposes.

With new styles and new economic forms emerging in the 1960s—as the US, eager to expand its mass consumerist model, pushed ready-to-wear, replacing European couture—American fashion became as a new power, intertwining economic and political, social, and cultural stakes. Thus, fashion helped design a dominant model of a wealthy, free, and seductive country, able to better itself, even though reality was still far from this idealized image.",

        "This article is chiefly concerned with Wallace Stegner’s ideas of aridity as the key to the understanding of the history and culture of the American West. It first examines the arguments of some major books published in the 1980s that helped strengthen Stegner’s conviction that the West was heading towards environmental disaster due to the rapidly increasing depletion of its rivers and aquifers, a projected ecological crisis that has grown even more acute at the beginning of the 21st century. The subsequent focus of this article, however, is on Stegner’s predominant proposition that the abuse of the arid nature of the West – the rampant disregard of its environmental limitations – is a product of a mindset and a culture that he finds particularly Western. In the course of his analysis, Stegner sees the rootlessness that typified his own family history as a direct reflection of the transientness characteristic of the collective history of the American West, which served to hamper the evolution of a sense of place that in his view is the prerequisite for a genuine stewardship of the land.",

In this essay, I examine the trajectory of this reform from the point of view of an \"insider-outsider\" Fulbright Scholar in General Education who, based at the University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong America Center (but working with colleagues across the system), consulted on the formation of interdisciplinary courses, interactive teaching, and administrative infrastructure for the launch of the reform. I examine the change in light of the flow of global capital, the development of the \"whole person\" familiar to us from the discourse of the Liberal Arts, and of the demands of multinationals based in Hong Kong for a differently trained globalized workforce. The Hong Kong experiment is, I argue, an illuminating site to examine in order for us to better understand the emergence of the global university.",

        "The article discusses the significance of elements of Italian identity (Italianità) for the language learning motivation of learners of Italian descent studying their heritage language (HL) by means of foreign language (FL) courses in Wellington, New Zealand. Adopting a social constructivist perspective on both second language learning and the motivational processes underlying it, the study utilizes qualitative data collected through waves of semi-structured interviews from five case-study participants to map the influence that their constructions of Italianità exert on their motivational trajectories over the course of several months of learning. The paper discusses a selection of data excerpts to show how motivational fluctuations are the result of the learners’ own processing of and reaction to elements of their sociocultural context. In particular, an analysis of the learners’ accounts of social exchanges and other crucial events involving the use of the HL outside the classroom will illustrate how these can support motivation by reinforcing the learners’ perceptions of their Italianità, strengthening existing learning goals and/or prompting the formation of new ones. The article concludes with some remarks on the implications for teaching practices and extra-curricular activities that could benefit HL learners by increasing their exposure to the HL outside the classroom while validating and encouraging the personal identity constructions and ambitions at the basis of their learning.",

Much of the literature to-date claims that CALL can have a positive impact on students’ second language acquisition (SLA). Mixed method of research produces data to investigate if CALL positively affects student language proficiency, motivation and autonomy. Classroom observation of participants in their natural environment is a qualitative technique used but has situational variables that could skew results if not structured. A questionnaire is a quantitative tool that can offer insight regarding participants’ perception of performance but can contradict what the researcher has observed. This paper will take an in-depth look at variables such as: instructor’s pedagogical application; blending CALL into the curriculum; types of CALL implemented; feedback received and their implications for design of the data collection tools",

        "Most, if not all, writings by Jamaican writer Michelle Cliff are connected by a subterranean desire to re-write Afro-Caribbean history from new untold perspectives in reaction to the immense loss and/or distortions that marked the region’s history for entire centuries. In this paper, I meticulously read four of Cliff’s texts--Abeng (1984), its sequel No Telephone to Heaven (1987), Claiming an Identity They Taught Me to Despise (1980) and The Land of Look Behind (1985)--to look at how Cliff retrieves her black ancestors’ submerged history and erased past. I particularly explore the methods Cliff deploys to re-center a history deliberately erased/or distorted by what she ironically calls “the official version” (Free Enterprise, 1994, p. 138) in allusion to the Eurocentric narratives about the twin imperial projects of slavery and colonialism. Finally, I investigate the wealth of possibilities offered by fiction, unrecorded memory, oral story-telling and imagination to out-tell Eurocentric historiography and re-write Afro-Caribbean history from the victims’ perspective: slaves, colonial subjects, marginalized female figures, black Diasporic characters, etc.\n\nKeywords: Michelle Cliff, “official” history, history re-writing, memory, fiction",
        "This classroom based research of a learning strategies model was designed to investigate its application in a mixed-ability classroom. The study built on Oxford’s language learning strategies model (1990, 2001) and fulfilled it with rhetorical strategies to accommodate challenges encountered in the paradigm of English as an international language (EIL). The main purpose aimed to explore Thai students’ self-efficacy beliefs (SE) in reading different texts regarding both Western and Asian styles after receiving a strategies-based training. In this research, thirty-three first-year undergraduate students majoring in English Education were purposively selected as participants for the training. The data from pre and post questionnaires focusing on students’ self-efficacy beliefs was analyzed using descriptive statistic and thematic analysis. The results revealed that students believed to have higher efficacy in EIL textual reading after learning strategies-based training. The presentation will also include discussion and suggestion in implementing rhetorical-language learning strategies in the classroom.",
        "One of the essential components of the early modern European response to China was an emphasis on the fabulous wealth and social organization of Chinese society. Despite their knowledge of the wide-scale abandonment and killing of newborns within the society, and despite the categorization of infanticide as a great moral sin by the early Christian church, the European travelers to China commented on infanticide dispassionately, without any moral revulsion, and continued to project an image of China as a virtual utopia for its residents. One reason for the detached descriptions of abandonment of children and infanticide in China might be the fact that conditions with regard to children in Europe were no superior to those in China and were probably far worse; the vast numbers of abandoned and dead children in Europe blunted the edge of criticism with regard to Chinese customs. Another might be that infanticide was practiced within Europe contemporaneously, even though the killing of newborn children there was practiced much more surreptitiously, and public opinion had firmed up connections among single women, illegitimacy, concealment, and murder. However, the dire social circumstances within their own countries had not prevented the Europeans from soundly criticizing and morally reproving cannibalism or infanticide in other cultures. In order to understand their acceptance of this “sinful” practice in China, we must look elsewhere.",
        "Flipped Classroom presents teaching process at home through videos, handouts and listening passages before the class session. While in-class time is mostly devoted for questions and answers session, exercises, projects and discussion. The reason flipped classroom is needed for teachers in this era, simply because at the time students do the assignments inside the classroom, teachers would have the opportunities to observe students’ interaction, activities, improvement and even to solve students’ problem such as academic dishonesty. Thus, the question would be: to what extent is the urgency of implementing flipped classroom as one solution to discourage students’ academic dishonesty in writing classes? The study is conducted by employing Action Research. The findings confirm that performing Flipped Classroom is essential in order to discourage students’ academic dishonesty while assisting the teacher to observe students’ development in writing classes.\n\n\n\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.24071/llt.2017.200103",
        "Vygotsky's concept of ZPD (Zone of Proximal Development) has been recently applied to the context of language teacher education by a number of researchers (e.g. Ohta, 2005; Singh & Richards, 2006; Nassaji & Cumming, 2000). Besides Vygotsky's notion of ZPD, this paper relies on two associated theories from outside the TESOL discipline namely; Valsiner's (1997) Zone theory and Blanton, Westbrook and Carter’s (2008)illusionary zone (IZ)to  provide a broad picture of the most influential variables facilitating or constraining teacher's professional development or, as specifically defined here, his ZPD progression. Several excerpts in the form of teacher comments taken from different qualitative studies in the related literature are given to lay evidence for the effect, if any, of the raised variables. Finally, the paper concludes with some practical tips for the pre/in-service language teachers as to how to keep their evolving ZPD dynamic in their long-life language teaching profession.",
        "Muslims have never ceased to be important for the West and have been depicted in vilifying and stereotypical manners in western literature and films. However, after the tragic event of 9/11, a dramatic change has been observed in the world’s focus towards Muslims. Although stereotypes and discriminatory actions were nothing new to Muslims, the post-9/11 backlash was absolutely terrible and heartbreaking. People have started to consider Muslims either terrorists or sympathetic to terrorists, and they have been suspected and distrusted. Lots of books, articles and films have depicted Muslims in a derogatory and extreme manner. Pre-9/11 Hollywood movies True Lies and The Siege explicitly show the stereotypical attitude of the West to Muslims while post-9/11 novels like The Reluctant Fundamentalist by Mohsin Hamid and Once in a Promised Land by Laila Halaby depict the plight and predicament of Muslims in America. The article aims to depict the stereotypical, vilifying and antagonistic attitudes of the West to Arabs and Muslims in both pre- and post- 9/11 era. It also aims to prove that the depiction is highly motivated by the media, western authorities and the West’s desire for social, cultural and political dominance over the East.\n\nKeywords: Orientalism, Others, Terrorism, Media",
        "The autobiographical writing by Emily Innes’s The Chersonese with the Gliding offer corded experiences and turbulence underwent by a White officer’s wife to Malaya with an underlying western perspectives and impression on the country during pre-Independence period and its people. By using narrative data, this article examines existing power relations, framed within interactions between the white lady (representing the Self) and her Malay male servants (as the Other). The use of Michel Foucault’s Technology of Power enables an analysis of power strategies that represent both binary opposites in order to also trace the existence of gender power. More specifically, it allows a proto- conceptualisation of types among Malay men that are identifiable during the pre-Independence period. Further understanding the Malay men, especially of their ego, is important in the growing interest over Postcolonial subject where it explores forms of resistance, portrayed by the Other in his daily power relation with the Self. Findings reveal that while power play exists within these interactions, it is a one-sided discourse which sanctions fair play as well as equality of power distribution.  \n\nKeywords: Malaya, Foucault’s Technologies of Power, Masculinity, Malay Man’s Ego, Malayness",
        "This research investigated the word reading performance of Persian speaking dyslexic children through the use of a reading test. For this reason, 15 Persian elementary developmental dyslexic student with the mean age of 9.6, (SD= 1.5) and 15 Persian unimpaired elementary student with the mean age of 9.6 ( SD= 1.4) were compared. The performance of the two groups was examined according to the effect of transparency variable. Participants were required to read a list of 32 one syllabic word and nonwords in order to compare the reaction times and error rates of reading transparent and opaque words and nonwords. Overall, the finding showed that dyslexic children encountered more problems in reading both transparent and opaque words than did unimpaired children. The finding also showed that reading the opaque words was harder than reading the transparent words for both groups. The results of this research show that specific charactristics of writing systems affect the word processing ability of individuals in the reading task.",
        "This research paper investigates two main volumes taken from Children's Literature Association Quarterly; the earlier one is Vol. 11 published in 1986, and the other one, a more recent one, Vol. 32 published in 2007, as to understand the differences and similarities regarding the approaches used in the articles to understand Children's Literature in terms of its multifarious aspects such us, literary genres, styles, themes, and methodologies. Such kind of comparison yielded that those differences between those two volumes cover new thematic suggestions, new treatment and projection of characters, and strict scholarship which make the newer volume different in terms of approaches from the earlier one. The research also concluded that modern analytical perspectives are probably the most obvious transformations and changes in the second volume.\n\nKeywords: Volume, approach, childhood, construction, scholarship, transformation, modernism, historicism, analysis",
        "From his first film—a twenty-minute short, “Expectations” (1982)—to his last—a three-hour masterpiece, 'Yi Yi' (2000)—Edward Yang, one of the leading figures of the Taiwan New Cinema movement, devoted his career to portraying the impact of neoliberal capitalism on the lives of the citizens of Taipei. Interestingly, Yang’s films often employ female perspectives to criticize Taiwan’s education system and transnational corporations for perpetuating neoliberal capitalism’s ideology of self-fulfillment and upward mobility. This paper draws upon feminist film theory to investigate the ways in which Yang’s third feature, 'The Terrorizers' (1986), utilizes various innovative cinematic languages to engender a multitude of women’s perspectives to expose male voyeurism and ultimately criticize the impact of neoliberal capitalism in Taipei.",
        "In this article, the author wants to theorise the dialectical images of London as signs, by using an Impressionist way of reading the visual and the verbal representations. Through reading three poems of London: William Wordsworth’s ‘Composed Upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802’, Oscar Wilde’s ‘Impression du Matin’, and Carol Ann Duffy’s ‘Woman Seated in the Underground, 1941’, the author intends to show an awareness of the Impressionist narrative technique in terms of the spatial representations of the city. The impressions – in both visual and verbal terms, come to show the way in which London is a gendered space, synthesising masculine and feminine metaphors into a sequence of unique narrations. Each moment represents a personal, a specific, and a dramatic London, which is depicted in colours, shapes, lines and emotions.",

        "Republic of Macedonia is an entity described as cultural mosaic, with strong multiethnic and multi-confessional basis, it is a point where East and West meet, it is well-known for the system of Macedonian salad. But, this society even after 25 year of social transition and 2001 Ohrid Agreement did not achieve to find the way of conclusive peace, stability and social eudemonia. The diversity is issue that from time to time produces turbulences, especially at the line of two main identity groups Macedonians-Christian Orthodox and Albanians-Muslim community.\n\nQuantitative data in this study were obtained on a sample of 219 young adults from Skopje (95 of Macedonian and 17 of Albanian ethnicity) and Tetovo (76 of Albanian and 31 of Macedonian ethnicity), aged from 18 to 35 years (M = 24.85, SD = 3.2). Main research question is that if there exist differences between young Macedonians and Albanians in their ethnic, religious and national identity? The objective of this paper is to give a scientific picture how categories as gender, marriage, family, ethnicity, religion, living place, Balkan, Europe are perceived by the youth, all this in favour of using them in producing affirmative actions, more productive societal policies and constructive society-building. Multiple social identities: their complexity and inclusiveness, the correlation of identity variables with SII and SIC are among issues analyzed in this paper. National dominance was more frequent among Macedonians. Our findings demonstrate that Albanian participants expressed strong social identity, as Albanians and as being Muslims. Only social identity inclusiveness is significantly related to societal and political attitudes, but ethnicity should be taken into consideration when this relationship is explored.",
        "Privatization is considered an initial step toward market economy, restructuring financial and economic sector that enables competition in the economy. Privatization is the most painful process in economy where beside legal establishment and political will, it includes also the aspect of fairness and honesty. Analysis of this process is based on the models and comparisons between Kosovo and countries of central and Eastern Europe, in order to give a clearer picture on the overall process of privatization in Kosovo\n\nMethodology that is used to analyze this issue is based on empirical results and also qualitative interpretation of the models and also on studying particular asset privatization process. A widely discussed case of privatization in Kosovo is that of Post and Telecom of Kosovo (PTK). Since each company has its own value, I have focused my appraising analysis on the financial statements with a special observation on Cash Flow from Operation, as the most significant indicator on showing how company is using her physical and human recourses to generate money. I have based my research on using methodology of discounted cash flow from operation analysis, even though the company valuation was done using net cash flow from operation analysis. Cash Flow valuation then was discounted by the T-bonds interest rate.\n\nThis paper tries to bring a conclusion that privatization process in Kosovo have not brought the results excepted, firstly by setting an inappropriate price of assets and lastly by restructuring overall privatization sector and the overall industry. Kosovo, consequently, lost a big opportunity to create a competitive environment of financial industry: starting from the banking industry followed the pension trust which remained at their initial steps of development",
        "Quantity implicatures are inferences triggered by an utterance based on what other utterances a speaker could have made instead. Using ideas and formalisms from game theory, I demonstrate that these inferences can be explained in a strictly Gricean sense as *rational behavior*. To this end, I offer a procedure for constructing the context of utterance insofar as it is relevant for quantity reasoning as a game between speaker and hearer. I then give a new solution concept that improves on classical equilibrium approaches in that it uniquely selects the desired \"empirically correct\" play in these interpretation games by a chain of back-and-forth reasoning about players' behavior. To make this formal approach more accessible to a wider audience, I give a simple algorithm with the help of which the model's solution can be computed without having to do heavy calculations of probabilities, expected utilities and the like. This rationalistic approach subsumes and improves on recent exhaustivity-based approaches. It makes correct and uniform predictions for quantity implicatures of various epistemic varieties, free choice readings of disjunctions, as well as a phenomenon tightly related to the latter, namely so-called \"simplification of disjunctive antecedents\".\r\n  \r\n  doi:10.3765/sp.4.1\r\n  \r\n  <a href=\"http://semantics-online.org/sp-bib/franke-2011.bib\">BibTeX info</a>",

It shows that the hypothesis alternative (ha) was accepted. It means that using authentic materials has influence on students’ achievement in listening comprehension.",
        "Revolts in Tunisia and Egypt have led many observers to speak of the “first digital revolution” in the Arab world. Social media sites, such as Twitter and Facebook, are now recognised as the important tools that facilitated the “Jasmine Revolution”. In fact, the willingness of the Mubarak government to block all internet connection in Egypt has demonstrated the concern over the power of new technologies in facilitating political change. The tenacity of the social movements that are still on-going in the Arab world continues to demonstrate the important role that networked technologies—such as the internet, satellite channels and social networking sites—play in revolutions. The revolutions demonstrate an effective use of social media and other network technologies as an organisational tool, and as a means of asserting pressure on current rulers and future governments. Accordingly, this article seeks to expose freedom of expression as a fundamental democratic principle and the internet network as a vehicle driving the demonstrations in the Arab countries of Tunisia and Egypt.",
        "Life under sentence of death can be a transformative process. One measure of this transformation can be found in last words, which often highlight the humanity of condemned prisoners on the threshold of execution, in sharp contrast to popular conceptions of these prisoners as evil, remorseless, and irredeemable. Our reading of last words suggests that the transformation process can be best understood by examining the dominant contours of the death row experience, the most recent formative experience in the lives of condemned prisoners before they are put to death.",

It has been revealed that the Natives were killed because of land issues, indicating that land issues and tenure rights are the epicenter of the problem. This article focuses on the cardinal point of Brazilian legal debates: keeping indigenous people’s tenure over the land they have been occupying immemorially. The analysis explores normative aspects on constitutional and legal protection over Brazilian indigenous rights and further scrutinizes the relevant case law that was settled before the Brazil’s Constitutional Court.",

        "Previous research suggests that social environmental and individual-level factors influence adolescent development and behavior over time. However, little attention has been devoted to examining how risk factors (i.e., parental support, peer delinquency,  self-control) affect trajectories of criminal behavior among female adolescents. Utilizing data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (n = 5138 females) and latent class analysis, three offending trajectories among females from late adolescence to early adulthood were identified: late escalators, late de-escalators, and stable low/abstainers. Next, the influence of social environmental and individual-level factors during adolescence (Wave 1) on these trajectories was assessed. Results identified key differences in the risk factors related to group placement. The implications of the findings for prevention and treatment services targeting adolescent females, and directions for future research,  are discussed.",
        "Trends in international human rights law have challenged States globally to rethink involuntary mental health interventions from a non-discrimination perspective. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in particular prohibits laws that discriminate on the basis of disability. However, a key criterion for compulsory mental health treatment under typical mental health legislation is a psychiatric diagnosis (in conjunction with risk of harm and other criteria). Hence, for people with mental health disabilities, rights to liberty and consent in healthcare are held to a different standard compared to other citizens. A prominent law reform option being explored by some governments and commentators for achieving non-discrimination is to replace the diagnostic criterion for triggering involuntary intervention with an assessment of mental capacity. After all, every citizen is subject to restrictions on autonomy where they are deemed to lack mental capacity, such as where concussion necessitates emergency service. However, the use of mental capacity “testing” is seen by diverse commentators as wanting in key respects. A prominent criticism comes from the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which considers mental capacity assessments a form of disability-based discrimination. This article queries the call to replace the diagnostic criterion in mental health law with an assessment of mental capacity in the light of jurisprudence on equality and non-discrimination in international human rights law. Instead, we examine the doctrine of necessity as an area of law, which might help identify specific thresholds for overriding autonomy in emergency circumstances that can be codified in a non-discriminatory way. We also consider the need for deliberative law reform processes to identify  such measures, and we suggest interim, short-term measures for creating a “supported decision-making regime” in the mental health context. The article focuses in particular on the Australian context of mental health law reform, though the analysis can be generalised to international trends in mental health law.",

        "On 25 September 2015, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly unanimously voted for the post-2015 UN resolution on the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) agenda. This article argues that although the post-2015 SDG agenda is an advance on its precursor the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)—especially for progressing the human rights of persons with disabilities in development settings, everywhere—it should nonetheless be approached with caution. This article will identify “three steps forward” for persons with disabilities within the broad content of the post-2015 SDGs, while also highlighting four potential “steps back”. It concludes persons with disabilities, disability rights advocates and their supporters must remain vigilant as the post-SDG UN resolution is now operationalised and implemented by UN Member States and their many partners. This is particularly so if the content of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is to be effectively integrated into the post-2015 development policy and planning landscape.",
        "The Australian state has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), which emphasizes a social justice-based, personalized service delivery model. The upcoming National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) reflects this model and aims to facilitate people living with a disability being able to access services while housed within the private residential market, a move away from a state-based combined residential/service care model. However, in Australia’s neo-liberal housing market government intervention tends to shy away from policies that overtly impose restrictions on private firms. Therefore, in the absence of a subsidy from the state, the CRPD is of limited use in encouraging private developers to improve the appropriateness of its new built stock for people with a disability. A more persuasive approach is to highlight the size, diversity, and economic power of the disability-friendly housing consumer market when housing provision is separated from disability care delivery. This paper examines the feasibility of sustaining innovation in the volume builder housing market by aligning accessibility promoting changes to the existing innovation channels within Australian firms, suggesting that the NDIS concentrate on assisting the housing industry transition to a make-to-order model from the current make-to-forecast one.",
        "The increasing prominence of new Internet and social media technologies and their growing importance as a source of health information are pushing the pharmaceutical industry towards digital channels. This paper explores the potential impacts of the pharmaceutical industry’s increasing interest in online marketing and considers how the existing regulatory framework in Canada translates into the social media sphere.  Direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) of prescription drugs is prohibited in Canada, as it is in most industrialized countries. Although Health Canada has reaffirmed that the existing DTCA regulations apply to new Internet and social media technologies, new dynamics such as user-generated content, consumer propagation, and targeted marketing make applying the existing regulations an uncertain process. Moreover, certain problems often associated with DTCA may be exacerbated in the social media context. Finally, there is skepticism around whether government regulators have the resources or political will to effectively monitor new digital media. As such, this paper considers not only the role of direct government regulation in monitoring and enforcing the regulation of DTCA, but also the role of third party oversight and industry self-regulation—both of which may play an important role in filling the gaps in the regulation of the Internet and social media.",
        "In 2007, China and Myanmar signed their first Bilateral Memorandum of Understanding on human trafficking. The two countries cemented this agreement with the unveiling of the first Border Liaison Office in Ruili City, located in China’s southwestern Yunnan Province — one of the primary border crossing points between China and Myanmar. The government focus on human trafficking on this border intersects with decades of struggles to curb the border’s porousness to drugs and HIV/AIDS. This paper is based on qualitative ethnographic participant observation and interviews with young Jingpo women living in Ruili City and investigates the risk of human trafficking as a by-product of cultural stigma associated with ethnic marginality, drugs, and HIV/AIDS. The case of Ruili warns us that the global shift towards regarding human trafficking as the single most perilous phenomenon of the current age obscures ongoing issues of vulnerability and cultural stigma for ethnic minority peoples globally. In lieu of state sponsored patrol and monitoring of the border, more attention must be paid to overlapping concerns of people living in border communities, including drug prevalence, disease, and ethnic marginalisation.",
        "The international movement of people as a result of conflict, natural disaster, and famine is increasingly challenging for States. The Refugee Convention and its additional protocols have proven to be inadequate for protecting many people from human rights abuses. Accordingly this paper seeks to ascertain whether self-determination may operate to protect permanent refugee and forced migrant communities. Self-determination is a human right that has attracted considerable controversy. However, its universal applicability and the strength of the right make it an attractive means of limiting the power of a State in respect of refugee and forced migrant communities. Drawing from historical analogy this article concludes that in limited circumstances self-determination may be available for permanent refugee or forced migrant communities.",

The article examines the manner in which the Framework applies to ISPs and looks at measures that ISPs can take to fulfil their responsibility to respect the right to privacy. It utilizes the challenges to the right to privacy to discuss some aspects of the extension of human rights responsibilities to corporations. These include the respective roles of government and non-state actors, the extent to which corporations may be required to act proactively in order to protect the privacy of clients, and the relevance of transnational activity.",
        "Experiments using P2X3 knock-out mice or more general P2X receptor antagonists suggest that P2X3 receptors contribute to visceral hypersensitivity. We aimed to investigate the effect of the selective P2X3 antagonist A-317491 on visceral sensitivity under physiological conditions, during acute colitis and in the post-inflammatory phase of colitis.Trinitrobenzene sulphonic-acid colitis was monitored by colonoscopy: on day 3 to confirm the presence of colitis and then every 4 days, starting from day 10, to monitor convalescence and determine the exact timepoint of endoscopic healing in each rat. Visceral sensitivity was assessed by quantifying visceromotor responses to colorectal distension in controls, rats with acute colitis and post-colitis rats. A-317491 was administered 30 min prior to visceral sensitivity testing. Expression of P2X3 receptors (RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry) and the intracellular signalling molecules cdk5, csk and CASK (RT-PCR) were quantified in colonic tissue and dorsal root ganglia. ATP release in response to colorectal distension was measured by luminiscence.Rats with acute TNBS-colitis displayed significant visceral hypersensitivity that was dose-dependently, but not fully, reversed by A-317491. Hypersenstivity was accompanied by an increased colonic release of ATP. Post-colitis rats also displayed visceral hypersensitivity that was dose-dependently reduced and fully normalized by A-317491 without increased release of ATP. A-317491 did not modify visceral sensitivity in controls. P2X3 mRNA and protein expression in the colon and dorsal root ganglia were similar in control, acute colitis and post-colitis groups, while colonic mRNA expression of cdk5, csk and CASK was increased in the post-colitis group only.These findings indicate that P2X3 receptors are not involved in sensory signaling under physiological conditions whereas they modulate visceral hypersensitivity during acute TNBS-colitis and even more so in the post-inflammatory phase, albeit via different mechanisms of sensitization, validating P2X3 receptors as potential new targets in the treatment of abdominal pain syndromes.",
        "The bioaccumulation and biomagnification of mercury (Hg) and selenium (Se) were investigated in sub-tropical freshwater food webs from Burkina Faso, West Africa, a region where very few ecosystem studies on contaminants have been performed. During the 2010 rainy season, samples of water, sediment, fish, zooplankton, and mollusks were collected from three water reservoirs and analysed for total Hg (THg), methylmercury (MeHg), and total Se (TSe). Ratios of δ13C and δ15N were measured to determine food web structures and patterns of contaminant accumulation and transfer to fish. Food chain lengths (FCLs) were calculated using mean δ15N of all primary consumer taxa collected as the site-specific baseline. We report relatively low concentrations of THg and TSe in most fish. We also found in all studied reservoirs short food chain lengths, ranging from 3.3 to 3.7, with most fish relying on a mixture of pelagic and littoral sources for their diet. Mercury was biomagnified in fish food webs with an enrichment factor ranging from 2.9 to 6.5 for THg and from 2.9 to 6.6 for MeHg. However, there was no evidence of selenium biomagnification in these food webs. An inverse relationship was observed between adjusted δ15N and log-transformed Se:Hg ratios, indicating that Se has a lesser protective effect in top predators, which are also the most contaminated animals with respect to MeHg. Trophic position, carbon source, and fish total length were the factors best explaining Hg concentration in fish. In a broader comparison of our study sites with literature data for other African lakes, the THg biomagnification rate was positively correlated with FCL. We conclude that these reservoir systems from tropical Western Africa have low Hg biomagnification associated with short food chains. This finding may partly explain low concentrations of Hg commonly reported in fish from this area.",
        "Unconscious mental processes have recently started gaining attention in a number of scientific disciplines. One of the theoretical frameworks for describing unconscious processes was introduced by Jung as a part of his model of the psyche. This framework uses the concept of archetypes that represent prototypical experiences associated with objects, people, and situations. Although the validity of Jungian model remains an open question, this framework is convenient from the practical point of view. Moreover, archetypes found numerous applications in the areas of psychology and marketing. Therefore, observation of both conscious and unconscious traces related to archetypal experiences seems to be an interesting research endeavor. In a study with 36 subjects, we examined the effects of experiencing conglomerations of unconscious emotions associated with various archetypes on the participants' introspective reports and patterns of physiological activations. Our hypothesis for this experiment was that physiological data may predict archetypes more precisely than introspective reports due to the implicit nature of archetypal experiences. Introspective reports were collected using the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) technique. Physiological measures included cardiovascular, electrodermal, respiratory responses and skin temperature of the subjects. The subjects were stimulated to feel four archetypal experiences and four explicit emotions by means of film clips. The data related to the explicit emotions served as a reference in analysis of archetypal experiences. Our findings indicated that while prediction models trained on the collected physiological data could recognize the archetypal experiences with accuracy of 55 percent, similar models built based on the SAM data demonstrated performance of only 33 percent. Statistical tests enabled us to confirm that physiological observations are better suited for observation of implicit psychological constructs like archetypes than introspective reports.",
        "It is thought that a large amount of albumin leaking from the glomerulus in nephrotic syndrome (NS) is reabsorbed at the proximal tubule and catabolized. Therefore, it is possible the final quantity of urinary protein does not always reflect the amount of leakage of protein from the glomerulus. We experienced two cases without nephrotic range proteinuria thought to involve hypoproteinemia due to the same pathophysiology as NS. On these patients, we performed protein leakage scintigraphy with technetium-99m human serum albumin diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (99mTc-HSAD) to exclude a diagnosis of protein-losing gastroenteropathy and observed diffuse positive accumulation in the kidneys with more intense uptake in the kidney than the liver on the anterior view 24 hours after 99mTc-HSAD administration. In healthy adults intravenously given 99mTc-HSAD, the same dynamics are observed as in albumin metabolism, and the organ radioactivity of the liver and kidneys after 24 hours is equal. Therefore, we thought it was possible that the renal uptake 24 hours after 99mTc-HSAD administration was a characteristic finding of NS. In order to confirm it, the subjects were divided into two groups: the NS group (n = 10) and the non-NS group (n = 7). We defined more intense uptake in the kidney than the liver on the anterior view 24 hours after 99mTc-HSAD administration as Dense Kidney (+). Furthermore, we designed regions of interest in the right and left kidneys and liver on anterior and posterior images, then calculated the kidney-liver ratio. Nine of the ten patients had Dense Kidney (+) in the NS group, compared to none in the non-NS group. And the kidney-liver ratio was significantly higher in the NS group than in the non-NS group on each view in the bilateral kidneys. In conclusion, our results suggest that the renal uptake 24 hours after 99mTc-HSAD administration is a characteristic finding of NS.",
        "Small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) may be useful for conducting high-precision, low-disturbance waterbird surveys, but limited data exist on their effectiveness. We evaluated the capacity of a small UAS to census a large (>6,000 nests) coastal Common tern (Sterna hirundo) colony of which ground surveys are particularly disruptive and time-consuming. We compared aerial photographic tern counts to ground nest counts in 45 plots (5-m radius) throughout the colony at three intervals over a nine-day period in order to identify sources of variation and establish a coefficient to estimate nest numbers from UAS surveys. We also compared a full colony ground count to full counts from two UAS surveys conducted the following day. Finally, we compared colony disturbance levels over the course of UAS flights to matched control periods. Linear regressions between aerial and ground counts in plots had very strong correlations in all three comparison periods (R2 = 0.972-0.989, P < 0.001) and regression coefficients ranged from 0.928-0.977 terns/nest. Full colony aerial counts were 93.6% and 94.0%, respectively, of the ground count. Varying visibility of terns with ground cover, weather conditions and image quality, and changing nest attendance rates throughout incubation were likely sources of variation in aerial detection rates. Optimally timed UAS surveys of Common tern colonies following our method should yield population estimates in the 93-96% range of ground counts. Although the terns were initially disturbed by the UAS flying overhead, they rapidly habituated to it. Overall, we found no evidence of sustained disturbance to the colony by the UAS. We encourage colonial waterbird researchers and managers to consider taking advantage of this burgeoning technology.",
        "Questionnaire studies suggest that hearing is declining among young adults. However, few studies have examined the reliability of hearing questionnaires among young adult subjects. This study examined the associations between pure tone audiometrically assessed (PTA) hearing loss and questionnaire responses in young to middle aged adults.A cross-sectional study using questionnaire and screening PTA (500 through 6000 Hz) data from 15322 Swedish subjects (62% women) aged 18 through 50 years. PTA hearing loss was defined as a hearing threshold above 20 dB in both ears at one or more frequencies. Data were analysed with chi-square tests, nonlinear regression, binary logistic regression, and the generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach.The prevalence of PTA hearing loss was 6.0% in men and 2.9% in women (p < 0.001). Slight hearing impairment was reported by 18.5% of the men and 14.8% of the women (p < 0.001), whereas 0.5% of men and women reported very impaired hearing. Using multivariate GEE modelling, the odds ratio of PTA hearing loss was 30.4 (95% CI, 12.7-72.9) in men and 36.5 (17.2-77.3) in women reporting very impaired hearing. The corresponding figures in those reporting slightly impaired hearing were 7.06 (5.25-9.49) in men and 8.99 (6.38-12.7) in women. These values depended on the sound stimulus frequency (p = 0.001). The area under the ROC curve was 0.904 (0.892-0.915) in men and 0.886 (0.872-0.900) in women.Subjective hearing impairment predicted clinically assessed hearing loss, suggesting that there is cause for concern as regards the future development of hearing in young to middle-aged people.",
        "To evaluate differences among poplar clones of various ploidies, 12 hybrid poplar clones (P. simonii × P. nigra) × (P. nigra × P. simonii) with different ploidies were used to study phenotypic variation in growth traits and photosynthetic characteristics. Analysis of variance showed remarkable differences for each of the investigated traits among these clones (P < 0.01). Coefficients of phenotypic variation (PCV) ranged from 2.38% to 56.71%, and repeatability ranged from 0.656 to 0.987. The Pn (photosynthetic rate) photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) curves of the 12 clones were S-shaped, but the Pn-ambient CO2 (Ca) curves were shaped like an inverted \"V\". The stomatal conductance (Gs)-PPFD and transpiration rate (Tr)-PPFD curves had an upward tendency; however, with increasing PFFD, the intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci)-PPFD curves had a downward tendency in all of the clones. The Pn-PPFD and Pn-Ca curves followed the pattern of a quadratic equation. The average light saturation point and light compensation point of the triploid clones were the highest and lowest, respectively, among the three types of clones. For Pn-Ca curves, diploid clones had a higher average CO2 saturation point and average CO2 compensation point compared with triploid and tetraploid clones. Correlation analyses indicated that all investigated traits were strongly correlated with each other. In future studies, molecular methods should be used to analyze poplar clones of different ploidies to improve our understanding of the growth and development mechanisms of polyploidy.",
        "During a citywide epidemic of serogroup C meningococcal disease in Salvador in 2010, Brazil, the state government initiated mass vaccination targeting two age groups with high attack rates: individuals aged <5 years and 10-24 years. More than 600,000 doses of meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccines were administered. We performed a case-control study to evaluate vaccine uptake, document vaccine effectiveness and identify reasons for non-vaccination.Population-based surveillance identified patients with laboratory-confirmed invasive meningococcal C (MenC) disease during 2010. Information on MenC vaccination was obtained from case patients and age-matched individuals from the same neighborhoods. MenC vaccine effectiveness was estimated based on the exact odds ratios obtained by conditional logistic regression analysis. Of 51 laboratory-confirmed cases of serogroup C meningococcal disease among patients <5 and 10-24 years of age 50 were included in the study and matched with 240 controls. Overall case-fatality was 25%. MenC vaccine coverage among controls increased from 7.1% to 70.2% after initiation of the vaccination campaign. None of the 50 case patients but 70 (29.2%) of the 240 control individuals, including 59 (70.2%) of 84 matched with cases from the period after MenC vaccination, had received at least one MenC vaccine dose. Overall effectiveness of MenC was 98% with a lower 95% exact confidence limit of 89%.MenC vaccines administered during the meningococcal epidemic were highly effective, suggesting that rapid vaccine uptake through campaigns contributed to control of meningococcal disease.",
        "Population-based HIV surveillance is crucial to inform understanding of the HIV pandemic and evaluate HIV interventions, but little is known about longitudinal participation patterns in such settings. We investigated the dynamics of longitudinal participation patterns in a high HIV prevalence surveillance setting in rural South Africa between 2003 and 2012, taking into account demographic dynamics. At any given survey round, 22,708 to 30,495 persons were eligible. Although the yearly participation rates were relatively modest (26% to 46%), cumulative rates increased substantially with multiple recruitment opportunities: 68% of eligible persons participated at least once, 48% at least twice and 31% at least three times after five survey rounds. We identified two types of study fatigue: at the individual level, contact and consent rates decreased with multiple recruitment opportunities and, at the population level, these rates also decreased over calendar time, independently of multiple recruitment opportunities. Using sequence analysis and hierarchical clustering, we identified three broad individual participation profiles: consenters (20%), switchers (43%) and refusers (37%). Men were over represented among refusers, women among consenters, and temporary non-residents among switchers. The specific subgroup of persons who were systemically not contacted or refusers constitutes a challenge for population-based surveillance and interventions.",
        "Four experiments examined the ability of respondents to identify letters that were displayed on an LED array with flashes lasting little more than a microsecond. The first experiment displayed each letter with a single, simultaneous flash of all the dots forming the letter and established the relation of flash intensity to the probability of letter identification. The second experiment displayed the letters with multiple flashes at different frequencies to determine the probability that the sequence of flashes would be perceived as fused. The third experiment displayed the letters at a frequency that was above the flicker-fusion frequency, varying flash intensity to establish the amount needed to elicit a given probability of letter identification. The fourth experiment displayed each letter twice, once at a frequency where no flicker was perceived and also with steady light emission. The intensity of each flash was fixed and the steady intensity was varied; respondents were asked to judge whether the fused-flicker display and the steady display appeared to be the same brightness. Steady intensity was about double the average flash intensity where the two conditions were perceived as being equal in brightness. This is at odds with Talbot-Plateau law, which predicts that these two values should be equal. The law was formulated relative to a flash lasting half of each period, so it is surprising that it comes this close to being correct where the flash occupies only a millionth of the total period.",
        "Dysregulated Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) signalling and genetic polymorphisms in these proteins are linked to many human diseases. We investigated TLR4 functional variants D299G and T399I to assess the impact on LPS-induced responsiveness in comparison to wild-type TLR4. The mechanism by which this occurs in unclear as these SNPs do not lie within the lipid A binding domain or dimerisation sites of the LPS-TLR4/MD2 receptor complexes. Transfection of TLR4D299G, TLR4T399I or TLR4D299G. T399I into HEK cells resulted in constitutive activation of an NF-κB reporter gene and a blunting of the LPS-induced reporter activation compared to WT-TLR4. Unstimulated human monocyte/macrophages, from patients with the D299G and T399I SNPs demonstrated a downregulation of many genes, particularly Tram/Trif signalling pathway constitutents compared to the TLR4 wild-type subjects supporting the concept of basal receptor activity. Monocyte/macrophages from carriers of the TLR4 D299G and T399I polymorphisms stimulated with LPS showed >6 fold lower levels of NF-κB and ∼12 fold higher IFN-β gene expression levels compared to wild-type subjects (P<0.05; MWU test) and dramatically altered resultant cytokine profiles. We conclude that these TLR4 SNPs affect constitutive receptor activity which impacts on the hosts ability to respond to LPS challenge leading to a dysregulated sub-optimal immune response to infection.",
        "Despite recent breakthroughs in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic within South Africa, the transmission of the virus continues at alarmingly high rates. It is possible, with the use of phylogenetic methods, to uncover transmission events of HIV amongst local communities in order to identify factors that may contribute to the sustained transmission of the virus. The aim of this study was to uncover transmission events of HIV amongst the infected population of Cape Town.We analysed gag p24 and RT-pol sequences which were generated from samples spanning over 21-years with advanced phylogenetic techniques. We identified two transmission clusters over a 21-year period amongst randomly sampled patients from Cape Town and the surrounding areas. We also estimated the origin of each of the identified transmission clusters with the oldest cluster dating back, on average, 30 years and the youngest dating back roughly 20 years.These transmission clusters represent the first identified transmission events among the heterosexual population in Cape Town. By increasing the number of randomly sampled specimens within a dataset over time, it is possible to start to uncover transmission events of HIV amongst local communities in generalized epidemics. This information can be used to produce targeted interventions to decrease transmission of HIV in Africa.",
        "Maternal physical activity during pregnancy could alter offspring's IQ and neurodevelopment in childhood.Children belonging to a birth cohort were followed at 3, 12, 24 and 48 months of age. Physical activity during pregnancy was assessed retrospectively at birth. Neurodevelopment was evaluated by Battelle's Development Inventory (12, 24 and 48 months) and IQ by the Weschler's Intelligence Scale (48 months). Neurodevelopment was based on Battelles' (90th percentile) and also analyzed as a continuous outcome. IQ was analyzed as a continuous outcome. Potential confounders were: family income, mother's age, schooling, skin color, number of previous births and smoking; and newborns': preterm birth, sex and low birth weight.From birth to 48 months, sample size decreased from 4231 to 3792. Crude analysis showed that IQ at 48 months was slightly higher (5 points) among children from active women. The Battelle's score at 12 and 24 months was higher among offspring from active mothers. After controlling for confounders, physical activity during pregnancy was positively associated to the Battelle's Inventory at 12 months IQ, however, at 48 months no association was observed.Physical activity during pregnancy does not seem to impair children's neurodevelopment and children from active mothers presented better performance at 12 months.",
        "Deficiencies of vitamin A and iron affect a significant portion of the world's population, and efforts to characterize patterns of these deficiencies are hampered by a lack of measurement tools appropriate for large-scale population-based surveys. Vitamin A and iron are not easily measured directly, so reliable proxy markers for deficiency status have been identified and adopted. Measurement of inflammatory markers is necessary to interpret vitamin A and iron status markers, because circulating levels are altered by inflammation. We developed a multiplex immunoassay method for simultaneous measurement of five markers relevant to assessing inflammation, vitamin A and iron status: α-1-acid glycoprotein, C-reactive protein, retinol binding protein 4, ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor. Serum and plasma specimens were used to optimize the assay protocol. To evaluate assay performance, plasma from 72 volunteers was assayed using the multiplex technique and compared to conventional immunoassay methods for each of the five markers. Results of the new and conventional assay methods were highly correlated (Pearson Correlations of 0.606 to 0.991, p<.0001). Inter-assay imprecision for the multiplex panel varied from 1% to 8%, and all samples fell within the limits of quantification for all assays at a single dilution. Absolute values given by the multiplex and conventional assays differed, indicating a need for further work to devise a new standard curve. This multiplexed micronutrient immunoassay technique has excellent potential as a cost effective tool for use in large-scale deficiency assessment efforts.",
        "Genome wide association studies (GWAs) of breast cancer mortality have identified few potential associations. The concordance between these studies is unclear. In this study, we used a meta-analysis of two prognostic GWAs and a replication cohort to identify the strongest associations and to evaluate the loci suggested in previous studies. We attempt to identify those SNPs which could impact overall survival irrespective of the age of onset.To facilitate the meta-analysis and to refine the association signals, SNPs were imputed using data from the 1000 genomes project. Cox-proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) in 536 patients from the POSH cohort (Prospective study of Outcomes in Sporadic versus Hereditary breast cancer) and 805 patients from the HEBCS cohort (Helsinki Breast Cancer Study). These hazard ratios were combined using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effects meta-analysis and a p-value threshold of 5×10(-8) was used to determine significance. Replication was performed in 1523 additional patients from the POSH study.Although no SNPs achieved genome wide significance, three SNPs have significant association in the replication cohort and combined p-values less than 5.6×10(-6). These SNPs are; rs421379 which is 556 kb upstream of ARRDC3 (HR = 1.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.27-1.75, P = 1.1×10(-6)), rs12358475 which is between ECHDC3 and PROSER2 (HR = 0.75, CI = 0.67-0.85, P = 1.8×10(-6)), and rs1728400 which is between LINC00917 and FOXF1.In a genome wide meta-analysis of two independent cohorts from UK and Finland, we identified potential associations at three distinct loci. Phenotypic heterogeneity and relatively small sample sizes may explain the lack of genome wide significant findings. However, the replication at three SNPs in the validation cohort shows promise for future studies in larger cohorts. We did not find strong evidence for concordance between the few associations highlighted by previous GWAs of breast cancer survival and this study.",
        "Accurate and reliable quantification of the abundance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules, both wild-type and those harbouring pathogenic mutations, is important not only for understanding the progression of mtDNA disease but also for evaluating novel therapeutic approaches. A clear understanding of the sensitivity of mtDNA measurement assays under different experimental conditions is therefore critical, however it is routinely lacking for most published mtDNA quantification assays. Here, we comprehensively assess the variability of two quantitative Taqman real-time PCR assays, a widely-applied MT-ND1/MT-ND4 multiplex mtDNA deletion assay and a recently developed MT-ND1/B2M singleplex mtDNA copy number assay, across a range of DNA concentrations and mtDNA deletion/copy number levels. Uniquely, we provide a specific guide detailing necessary numbers of sample and real-time PCR plate replicates for accurately and consistently determining a given difference in mtDNA deletion levels and copy number in homogenate skeletal muscle DNA.",
        "Establishing the extent, geographical distribution and mechanisms of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors is a prerequisite for resistance management. Here, we report a widespread distribution of insecticide resistance in the major malaria vector An. funestus across Uganda and western Kenya under the control of metabolic resistance mechanisms.Female An. funestus collected throughout Uganda and western Kenya exhibited a Plasmodium infection rate between 4.2 to 10.4%. Widespread resistance against both type I (permethrin) and II (deltamethrin) pyrethroids and DDT was observed across Uganda and western Kenya. All populations remain highly susceptible to carbamate, organophosphate and dieldrin insecticides. Knockdown resistance plays no role in the pyrethroid and DDT resistance as no kdr mutation associated with resistance was detected despite the presence of a F1021C replacement. Additionally, no signature of selection was observed on the sodium channel gene. Synergist assays and qRT-PCR indicated that metabolic resistance plays a major role notably through elevated expression of cytochrome P450s. DDT resistance mechanisms differ from West Africa as the L119F-GSTe2 mutation only explains a small proportion of the genetic variance to DDT resistance.The extensive distribution of pyrethroid and DDT resistance in East African An. funestus populations represents a challenge to the control of this vector. However, the observed carbamate and organophosphate susceptibility offers alternative solutions for resistance management.",
        "L-glutamine is an efficacious glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 secretagogue in vitro. When administered with a meal, glutamine increases GLP-1 and insulin excursions and reduces postprandial glycaemia in type 2 diabetes patients. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of daily glutamine supplementation with or without the dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor sitagliptin in well-controlled type 2 diabetes patients.Type 2 diabetes patients treated with metformin (n = 13, 9 men) with baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.1±0.3% (54±4 mmol/mol) received glutamine (15 g bd)+ sitagliptin (100 mg/d) or glutamine (15 g bd) + placebo for 4 weeks in a randomized crossover study.HbA1c (P = 0.007) and fructosamine (P = 0.02) decreased modestly, without significant time-treatment interactions (both P = 0.4). Blood urea increased (P<0.001) without a significant time-treatment interaction (P = 0.8), but creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were unchanged (P≥0.5). Red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and albumin modestly decreased (P≤0.02), without significant time-treatment interactions (P≥0.4). Body weight and plasma electrolytes remained unchanged (P≥0.2).Daily oral supplementation of glutamine with or without sitagliptin for 4 weeks decreased glycaemia in well-controlled type 2 diabetes patients, but was also associated with mild plasma volume expansion.ClincalTrials.gov NCT00673894.",
        "We have previously reported high ten-week mortality from cryptococcal meningitis in Malawian adults following treatment-induction with 800 mg oral fluconazole (57% [33/58]). National guidelines in Malawi and other African countries now advocate an increased induction dose of 1200 mg. We assessed whether this has improved outcomes.This was a prospective observational study of HIV-infected adults with cryptococcal meningitis confirmed by diagnostic lumbar puncture. Treatment was with fluconazole 1200 mg/day for two weeks then 400mg/day for 8 weeks. Mortality within the first 10 weeks was the study end-point, and current results were compared with data from our prior patient cohort who started on fluconazole 800 mg/day.47 participants received fluconazole monotherapy. Despite a treatment-induction dose of 1200 mg, ten-week mortality remained 55% (26/47). This was no better than our previous study (Hazard Ratio [HR] of death on 1200 mg vs. 800 mg fluconazole: 1.29 (95% CI: 0.77-2.16, p = 0.332)). There was some evidence for improved survival in patients who had repeat lumbar punctures during early therapy to lower intracranial pressure (HR: 0.27 [95% CI: 0.07-1.03, p = 0.055]).There remains an urgent need to identify more effective, affordable and deliverable regimens for cryptococcal meningitis.",
        "Pubertal dynamics plays an important role in physical and psychological development of children and adolescents. We aim to provide reference ranges of plasma testosterone in a large longitudinal sample. Furthermore, we describe a measure of testosterone trajectories during adolescence that can be used in future investigations of development.We carried out longitudinal measurements of plasma testosterone in 2,216 samples obtained from 513 males (9 to 17 years of age) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. We used integration of a model fitted to each participant's testosterone trajectory to calculate a measure of average exposure to testosterone over adolescence. We pooled these data with corresponding values reported in the literature to provide a reference range of testosterone levels in males between the ages of 6 and 19 years.The average values of total testosterone in the ALSPAC sample range from 0.82 nmol/L (Standard Deviation [SD]: 0.09) at 9 years of age to 16.5 (SD: 2.65) nmol/L at 17 years of age; these values are congruent with other reports in the literature. The average exposure to testosterone is associated with different features of testosterone trajectories such as Peak Testosterone Change, Age at Peak Testosterone Change, and Testosterone at 17 years of age as well as the timing of the growth spurt during puberty.The average exposure to testosterone is a useful measure for future investigations using testosterone trajectories to examine pubertal dynamics.",
        "The ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) is expressed by T-cell subsets, myeloid derived suppressive cells and endothelial cells. It works in conjunction with CD39 to regulate the formation and degradation of adenosine in vivo. Adenosine has previously been shown to suppress the proliferation and cytokine secretion of T-cells and recent evidence suggests that inhibition of CD73 has the potential to enhance T-cell directed therapies. Here we utilised a CD73 knockout mouse model to assess the suppressive ability of CD73 on CD8+ T-cell classical memory and memory \"inflation\", induced by murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection and adenovirus immunisation. We show that CD73 is dispensable for normal CD8+ T-cell differentiation and function in both models. Thus CD73 as a suppressor of CD8+ T-cells is unlikely to play a deterministic role in the generation and functional characteristics of antiviral memory in these settings.",
        "Escherichia coli (ETEC) strain H10407 contains a GTPase virulence factor, LeoA, which is encoded on a pathogenicity island and has been shown to enhance toxin release, potentially through vesicle secretion. By sequence comparisons and X-ray structure determination we now identify LeoA as a bacterial dynamin-like protein (DLP). Proteins of the dynamin family remodel membranes and were once thought to be restricted to eukaryotes. In ETEC H10407 LeoA localises to the periplasm where it forms a punctate localisation pattern. Bioinformatic analyses of leoA and the two upstream genes leoB and leoC suggest that LeoA works in concert with a second dynamin-like protein, made up of LeoB and LeoC. Disruption of the leoAB genes leads to a reduction in secretion of periplasmic Tat-GFP and outer membrane OmpA. Our data suggest a role for LeoABC dynamin-like proteins in potentiating virulence through membrane vesicle associated toxin secretion.",
        "Previous reviews on risk and protective factors for violence in psychosis have produced contrasting findings. There is therefore a need to clarify the direction and strength of association of risk and protective factors for violent outcomes in individuals with psychosis.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis using 6 electronic databases (CINAHL, EBSCO, EMBASE, Global Health, PsycINFO, PUBMED) and Google Scholar. Studies were identified that reported factors associated with violence in adults diagnosed, using DSM or ICD criteria, with schizophrenia and other psychoses. We considered non-English language studies and dissertations. Risk and protective factors were meta-analysed if reported in three or more primary studies. Meta-regression examined sources of heterogeneity. A novel meta-epidemiological approach was used to group similar risk factors into one of 10 domains. Sub-group analyses were then used to investigate whether risk domains differed for studies reporting severe violence (rather than aggression or hostility) and studies based in inpatient (rather than outpatient) settings.There were 110 eligible studies reporting on 45,533 individuals, 8,439 (18.5%) of whom were violent. A total of 39,995 (87.8%) were diagnosed with schizophrenia, 209 (0.4%) were diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and 5,329 (11.8%) were diagnosed with other psychoses. Dynamic (or modifiable) risk factors included hostile behaviour, recent drug misuse, non-adherence with psychological therapies (p values<0.001), higher poor impulse control scores, recent substance misuse, recent alcohol misuse (p values<0.01), and non-adherence with medication (p value <0.05). We also examined a number of static factors, the strongest of which were criminal history factors. When restricting outcomes to severe violence, these associations did not change materially. In studies investigating inpatient violence, associations differed in strength but not direction.Certain dynamic risk factors are strongly associated with increased violence risk in individuals with psychosis and their role in risk assessment and management warrants further examination.",
        "Platelet-mediated clumping of Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes (IEs) is a frequently observed parasite adhesion phenotype. The importance of clumping in severe malaria and the molecular mechanisms behind this phenomenon are incompletely understood. Three platelet surface molecules have previously been identified as clumping receptors: CD36, globular C1q receptor (gC1qR/HABP1/p32), and P-selectin (CD62P), but the parasite ligands mediating this phenotype are unknown. The aim of this work was to develop a selection method to facilitate investigations of the molecular mechanisms of clumping in selected P. falciparum lines. Magnetic beads coated with anti-platelet antibodies were used to positively and negatively select clumping IEs from P. falciparum strains IT, HB3, 3D7 and Dd2. Clumping in all four positively selected parasite lines was abolished by antibodies to CD36, but was not affected by antibodies to gC1qR or P-selectin. Clumping positive lines showed significantly higher binding to CD36 than clumping negative lines in flow adhesion assays (strains IT, HB3 and 3D7, p<0.05 for all strains, paired t test) and static assays (strain Dd2, p<0.0001 paired t test). However, clumping negative lines IT, HB3 and 3D7 did show some binding to CD36 under flow conditions, indicating that CD36-binding is not sufficient for clumping. These data show that CD36-dependent clumping positive and negative lines can easily be selected from P. falciparum laboratory strains. CD36-binding is necessary but not sufficient for clumping, and the molecular differences between clumping positive and negative parasite lines responsible for the phenotype require further investigation.",
        "Genetic factors explain a majority of risk variance for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for late AMD implicate genes in complement, inflammatory and lipid pathways, the genetic architecture of early AMD has been relatively under studied. We conducted a GWAS meta-analysis of early AMD, including 4,089 individuals with prevalent signs of early AMD (soft drusen and/or retinal pigment epithelial changes) and 20,453 individuals without these signs. For various published late AMD risk loci, we also compared effect sizes between early and late AMD using an additional 484 individuals with prevalent late AMD. GWAS meta-analysis confirmed previously reported association of variants at the complement factor H (CFH) (peak P = 1.5×10(-31)) and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) (P = 4.3×10(-24)) loci, and suggested Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) polymorphisms (rs2075650; P = 1.1×10(-6)) associated with early AMD. Other possible loci that did not reach GWAS significance included variants in the zinc finger protein gene GLI3 (rs2049622; P = 8.9×10(-6)) and upstream of GLI2 (rs6721654; P = 6.5×10(-6)), encoding retinal Sonic hedgehog signalling regulators, and in the tyrosinase (TYR) gene (rs621313; P = 3.5×10(-6)), involved in melanin biosynthesis. For a range of published, late AMD risk loci, estimated effect sizes were significantly lower for early than late AMD. This study confirms the involvement of multiple established AMD risk variants in early AMD, but suggests weaker genetic effects on the risk of early AMD relative to late AMD. Several biological processes were suggested to be potentially specific for early AMD, including pathways regulating RPE cell melanin content and signalling pathways potentially involved in retinal regeneration, generating hypotheses for further investigation.",
        "Helminth infections may modulate immune responses to unrelated pathogens and allergens; these effects may commence prenatally. We addressed the hypothesis that anthelminthic treatment in pregnancy and early childhood would improve responses to immunisation and modulate disease incidence in early childhood with both beneficial and detrimental effects.A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Entebbe, Uganda [ISRCTN32849447]. In three independent randomisations, 2507 pregnant women were allocated to receive single-dose albendazole or placebo, and praziquantel or placebo; 2016 of their offspring were randomised to receive quarterly single-dose albendazole or placebo from age 15 months to 5 years. Primary outcomes were post-immunisation recall responses to BCG and tetanus antigens, and incidence of malaria, diarrhoea, and pneumonia; incidence of eczema was an important secondary outcome. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Of 2345 live births, 1622 (69%) children remained in follow-up at age 5 years. 68% of mothers at enrolment, and 11% of five-year-olds, had helminth infections. Maternal hookworm and Schistosoma mansoni were effectively treated by albendazole and praziquantel, respectively; and childhood hookworm and Ascaris by quarterly albendazole. Incidence rates of malaria, diarrhoea, pneumonia, and eczema were 34, 65, 10 and 5 per 100 py, respectively. Albendazole during pregnancy caused an increased rate of eczema in the children (HR 1.58 (95% CI 1.15-2.17), p = 0.005). Quarterly albendazole during childhood was associated with reduced incidence of clinical malaria (HR 0.85 (95% CI 0.73-0.98), p = 0.03). There were no consistent effects of the interventions on any other outcome.Routine use of albendazole in pregnancy may not always be beneficial, even in tropical developing countries. By contrast, regular albendazole treatment in preschool children may have an additional benefit for malaria control where helminths and malaria are co-endemic. Given the low helminth prevalence in our children, the effect of albendazole on malaria is likely to be direct.Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN32849447.",
        "Recent advances in genomics technologies have spurred unprecedented efforts in genome and exome re-sequencing aiming to unravel the genetic component of rare and complex disorders. While in rare disorders this allowed the identification of novel causal genes, the missing heritability paradox in complex diseases remains so far elusive. Despite rapid advances of next-generation sequencing, both the technology and the analysis of the data it produces are in its infancy. At present there is abundant knowledge pertaining to the role of rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in rare disorders and of common SNVs in common disorders. Although the 1,000 genome project has clearly highlighted the prevalence of rare variants and more complex variants (e.g. insertions, deletions), their role in disease is as yet far from elucidated.We set out to analyse the properties of sequence variants identified in a comprehensive collection of exome re-sequencing studies performed on samples from patients affected by a broad range of complex and rare diseases (N = 173). Given the known potential for Loss of Function (LoF) variants to be false positive, we performed an extensive validation of the common, rare and private LoF variants identified, which indicated that most of the private and rare variants identified were indeed true, while common novel variants had a significantly higher false positive rate. Our results indicated a strong enrichment of very low-frequency insertion/deletion variants, so far under-investigated, which might be difficult to capture with low coverage and imputation approaches and for which most of study designs would be under-powered. These insertions and deletions might play a significant role in disease genetics, contributing specifically to the underlining rare and private variation predicted to be discovered through next generation sequencing.",
        "Scrub typhus is an important endemic disease of the Asia-Pacific region caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. To develop an effective vaccine to prevent scrub typhus infection, a better understanding of the initial host-pathogen interaction is needed. The objective of this study was to investigate early bacterial dissemination in a CD-1 Swiss outbred mouse model after intradermal injection of O. tsutsugamushi. Three human pathogenic strains of O. tsutsugamushi (Karp, Gilliam, and Woods) were chosen to investigate the early infection characteristics associated with bacterial virulence. Tissue biopsies of the intradermal injection site and draining lymph nodes were examined using histology and immunohistochemistry to characterize bacterial dissemination, and correlated with quantitative real-time PCR for O. tsutsugamushi in blood and tissue from major organs. Soluble adhesion molecules were measured to examine cellular activation in response to infection. No eschar formation was seen at the inoculation site and no clinical disease developed within the 7 day period of observation. However, O. tsutsugamushi was localized at the injection site and in the draining lymph nodes by day 7 post inoculation. Evidence of leukocyte and endothelial activation was present by day 7 with significantly raised levels of sL-selectin, sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1. Infection with the Karp strain was associated with earlier and higher bacterial loads and more extensive dissemination in various tissues than the less pathogenic Gilliam and Woods strains. The bacterial loads of O. tsutsugamushi were highest in the lungs and spleens of mice inoculated with Karp and Gilliam, but not Woods strains. Strains of higher virulence resulted in more rapid systemic infection and dissemination in this model. The CD-1 mouse intradermal inoculation model demonstrates features relevant to early scrub typhus infection in humans, including the development of regional lymphadenopathy, leukocyte activation and distant organ dissemination after low-dose intradermal injection with O. tsutsugamushi.",
        "Transmission through breastfeeding remains important for mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) in resource-limited settings. We quantify the relationship between cell-free (RNA) and cell-associated (DNA) shedding of HIV-1 virus in breastmilk and the risk of postnatal HIV-1 transmission in the first 6 months postpartum.Thirty-six HIV-positive mothers who transmitted HIV-1 by breastfeeding were matched to 36 non-transmitting HIV-1 infected mothers in a case-control study nested in a cohort of HIV-infected women. RNA and DNA were quantified in the same breastmilk sample taken at 6 weeks and 6 months. Cox regression analysis assessed the association between cell-free and cell-associated virus levels and risk of postnatal HIV-1 transmission.There were higher median levels of cell-free than cell-associated HIV-1 virus (per ml) in breastmilk at 6 weeks and 6 months. Multivariably, adjusting for antenatal CD4 count and maternal plasma viral load, at 6 weeks, each 10-fold increase in cell-free or cell-associated levels (per ml) was significantly associated with HIV-1 transmission but stronger for cell-associated than cell-free levels [2.47 (95% CI 1.33-4.59) vs. aHR 1.52 (95% CI, 1.17-1.96), respectively]. At 6 months, cell-free and cell-associated levels (per ml) in breastmilk remained significantly associated with HIV-1 transmission but was stronger for cell-free than cell-associated levels [aHR 2.53 (95% CI 1.64-3.92) vs. 1.73 (95% CI 0.94-3.19), respectively].The findings suggest that cell-associated virus level (per ml) is more important for early postpartum HIV-1 transmission (at 6 weeks) than cell-free virus. As cell-associated virus levels have been consistently detected in breastmilk despite antiretroviral therapy, this highlights a potential challenge for resource-limited settings to achieve the UNAIDS goal for 2015 of eliminating vertical transmission. More studies would further knowledge on mechanisms of HIV-1 transmission and help develop more effective drugs during lactation.",
        "Melioidosis (Burkholderia pseudomallei infection) is a common cause of community-acquired sepsis in Northeast Thailand and northern Australia. B. pseudomallei is a soil saprophyte endemic to Southeast Asia and northern Australia. The clinical presentation of melioidosis may mimic tuberculosis (both cause chronic suppurative lesions unresponsive to conventional antibiotics and both commonly affect the lungs). The two diseases have overlapping risk profiles (e.g., diabetes, corticosteroid use), and both B. pseudomallei and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are intracellular pathogens. There are however important differences: the majority of melioidosis cases are acute, not chronic, and present with severe sepsis and a mortality rate that approaches 50% despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy. By contrast, tuberculosis is characteristically a chronic illness with mortality <2% with appropriate antimicrobial chemotherapy. We examined the gene expression profiles of total peripheral leukocytes in two cohorts of patients, one with acute melioidosis (30 patients and 30 controls) and another with tuberculosis (20 patients and 24 controls). Interferon-mediated responses dominate the host response to both infections, and both type 1 and type 2 interferon responses are important. An 86-gene signature previously thought to be specific for tuberculosis is also found in melioidosis. We conclude that the host responses to melioidosis and to tuberculosis are similar: both are dominated by interferon-signalling pathways and this similarity means gene expression signatures from whole blood do not distinguish between these two diseases.",
        "Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) catalyses the synthesis of cyclic GMP in response to nitric oxide. The enzyme is a heterodimer of homologous α and β subunits, each of which is composed of multiple domains. We present here crystal structures of a heterodimer of the catalytic domains of the α and β subunits, as well as an inactive homodimer of β subunits. This first structure of a metazoan, heteromeric cyclase provides several observations. First, the structures resemble known structures of adenylate cyclases and other guanylate cyclases in overall fold and in the arrangement of conserved active-site residues, which are contributed by both subunits at the interface. Second, the subunit interaction surface is promiscuous, allowing both homodimeric and heteromeric association; the preference of the full-length enzyme for heterodimer formation must derive from the combined contribution of other interaction interfaces. Third, the heterodimeric structure is in an inactive conformation, but can be superposed onto an active conformation of adenylate cyclase by a structural transition involving a 26° rigid-body rotation of the α subunit. In the modelled active conformation, most active site residues in the subunit interface are precisely aligned with those of adenylate cyclase. Finally, the modelled active conformation also reveals a cavity related to the active site by pseudo-symmetry. The pseudosymmetric site lacks key active site residues, but may bind allosteric regulators in a manner analogous to the binding of forskolin to adenylate cyclase. This indicates the possibility of developing a new class of small-molecule modulators of guanylate cyclase activity targeting the catalytic domain.",
        "Children in malaria endemic areas acquire immunity to severe malaria faster than to mild malaria. Only a minority of children suffers from severe malaria and it is not known what determines this. The aim of this study was to establish how P. falciparum infections during the first years of life affect the risk of severe malaria. A matched case-control study was nested within a large birth cohort set up to study the immunoepidemiology of pneumococci on the Kenyan coast. Infection patterns in three-monthly blood samples in cohort children admitted to hospital with severe malaria were compared to controls matched on age, residential location and time of sampling. P. falciparum detected at least once from birth conferred an increased risk of severe malaria and particularly if multiclonal infections, as characterized by genotyping of a polymorphic antigen gene, were ever detected. The results show for the first time that children with severe malaria have more infections early in life compared to community controls. These findings provide important insights on the immunity to severe disease, knowledge essential for the development of a vaccine against severe malaria.",
        "Previously we have shown that insertion of IS1301 in the sia/ctr intergenic region (IGR) of serogroup C Neisseria meningitidis (MenC) isolates from Spain confers increased resistance against complement-mediated killing. Here we investigate the significance of IS1301 in the same location in N. meningitidis isolates from the UK. PCR and sequencing was used to screen a collection of more than 1500 meningococcal carriage and disease isolates from the UK for the presence of IS1301 in the IGR. IS1301 was not identified in the IGR among vaccine failure strains but was frequently found in serogroup B isolates (MenB) from clonal complex 269 (cc269). Almost all IS1301 insertions in cc269 were associated with novel polymorphisms, and did not change capsule expression or resistance to human complement. After excluding sequence types (STs) distant from the central genotype within cc269, there was no significant difference for the presence of IS1301 in the IGR of carriage isolates compared to disease isolates. Isolates with insertion of IS1301 in the IGR are not responsible for MenC disease in UK vaccine failures. Novel polymorphisms associated with IS1301 in the IGR of UK MenB isolates do not lead to the resistance phenotype seen for IS1301 in the IGR of MenC isolates.",
        "HIRA (or Hir) proteins are conserved histone chaperones that function in multi-subunit complexes to mediate replication-independent nucleosome assembly. We have previously demonstrated that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe HIRA proteins, Hip1 and Slm9, form a complex with a TPR repeat protein called Hip3. Here we have identified a new subunit of this complex.To identify proteins that interact with the HIRA complex, rapid affinity purifications of Slm9 were performed. Multiple components of the chaperonin containing TCP-1 complex (CCT) and the 19S subunit of the proteasome reproducibly co-purified with Slm9, suggesting that HIRA interacts with these complexes. Slm9 was also found to interact with a previously uncharacterised protein (SPBC947.08c), that we called Hip4. Hip4 contains a HRD domain which is a characteristic of the budding yeast and human HIRA/Hir-binding proteins, Hpc2 and UBN1. Co-precipitation experiments revealed that Hip4 is stably associated with all of the other components of the HIRA complex and deletion of hip4(+) resulted in the characteristic phenotypes of cells lacking HIRA function, such as temperature sensitivity, an elongated cell morphology and hypersensitivity to the spindle poison, thiabendazole. Moreover, loss of Hip4 function alleviated the heterochromatic silencing of reporter genes located in the mating type locus and centromeres and was associated with increased levels of non-coding transcripts derived from centromeric repeat sequences. Hip4 was also found to be required for the distinct form of silencing that controls the expression of Tf2 LTR retrotransposons.Overall, these results indicate that Hip4 is an integral component of the HIRA complex that is required for transcriptional silencing at multiple loci.",
        "Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to detect copy number variants (CNVs) in mammalian genomes has led to a growing awareness of the potential importance of this category of sequence variation as a cause of phenotypic variation. Yet there are large discrepancies between studies, so that the extent of the genome affected by CNVs is unknown. We combined molecular and aCGH analyses of CNVs in inbred mouse strains to investigate this question.Using a 2.1 million probe array we identified 1,477 deletions and 499 gains in 7 inbred mouse strains. Molecular characterization indicated that approximately one third of the CNVs detected by the array were false positives and we estimate the false negative rate to be more than 50%. We show that low concordance between studies is largely due to the molecular nature of CNVs, many of which consist of a series of smaller deletions and gains interspersed by regions where the DNA copy number is normal.Our results indicate that CNVs detected by arrays may be the coincidental co-localization of smaller CNVs, whose presence is more likely to perturb an aCGH hybridization profile than the effect of an isolated, small, copy number alteration. Our findings help explain the hitherto unexplored discrepancies between array-based studies of copy number variation in the mouse genome.",
        "Early recognition and prompt and appropriate antibiotic treatment can significantly reduce mortality from serious bacterial infections (SBI). The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of five markers of infection: C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), CD163 and high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), as markers of SBI in severely ill Malawian children.Children presenting with a signs of meningitis (n = 282) or pneumonia (n = 95), were prospectively recruited. Plasma samples were taken on admission for CRP, PCT, sTREM-1 CD163 and HMGB1 and the performance characteristics of each test to diagnose SBI and to predict mortality were determined. Of 377 children, 279 (74%) had SBI and 83 (22%) died. Plasma CRP, PCT, CD163 and HMGB1 and were higher in HIV-infected children than in HIV-uninfected children (p<0.01). In HIV-infected children, CRP and PCT were higher in children with SBI compared to those with no detectable bacterial infection (p<0.0005), and PCT and CD163 were higher in non-survivors (p = 0.001, p = 0.05 respectively). In HIV-uninfected children, CRP and PCT were also higher in children with SBI compared to those with no detectable bacterial infection (p<0.0005), and CD163 was higher in non-survivors (p = 0.05). The best predictors of SBI were CRP and PCT, and areas under the curve (AUCs) were 0.81 (95% CI 0.73-0.89) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.79-0.92) respectively. The best marker for predicting death was PCT, AUC 0.61 (95% CI 0.50-0.71).Admission PCT and CRP are useful markers of invasive bacterial infection in severely ill African children. The study of these markers using rapid tests in a less selected cohort would be important in this setting.",
        "This paper questions the need for reinforcement learning or control theory when optimising behaviour. We show that it is fairly simple to teach an agent complicated and adaptive behaviours using a free-energy formulation of perception. In this formulation, agents adjust their internal states and sampling of the environment to minimize their free-energy. Such agents learn causal structure in the environment and sample it in an adaptive and self-supervised fashion. This results in behavioural policies that reproduce those optimised by reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. Critically, we do not need to invoke the notion of reward, value or utility. We illustrate these points by solving a benchmark problem in dynamic programming; namely the mountain-car problem, using active perception or inference under the free-energy principle. The ensuing proof-of-concept may be important because the free-energy formulation furnishes a unified account of both action and perception and may speak to a reappraisal of the role of dopamine in the brain.",
        "During vertebrate embryogenesis, somites are generated at regular intervals, the temporal and spatial periodicity of which is governed by a gradient of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and/or Wnt signaling activity in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) in conjunction with oscillations of gene expression of components of the Notch, Wnt and FGF signaling pathways.Here, we show that the expression of Sprouty4, which encodes an FGF inhibitor, oscillates in 2-h cycles in the mouse PSM in synchrony with other oscillating genes from the Notch signaling pathway, such as lunatic fringe. Sprouty4 does not oscillate in Hes7-null mutant mouse embryos, and Hes7 can inhibit FGF-induced transcriptional activity of the Sprouty4 promoter.Thus, periodic expression of Sprouty4 is controlled by the Notch segmentation clock and may work as a mediator that links the temporal periodicity of clock gene oscillations with the spatial periodicity of boundary formation which is regulated by the gradient of FGF/Wnt activity.",
        "The tuberculin skin test (TST) is widely used in TB clinics to aid Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) diagnosis, but the definition and the significance of a positive test in very young children is still unclear. This study compared the TST in Gambian children at 4(1/2) months of age who either received BCG vaccination at birth (Group 1) or were BCG naïve (Group 2) in order to examine the role of BCG vaccination and/or exposure to environmental mycobacteria in TST reactivity at this age. Nearly half of the BCG vaccinated children had a positive TST (>or=5 mm) whereas all the BCG naïve children were non-reactive, confirming that recent BCG vaccination affects TST reactivity. The BCG naïve children demonstrated in vitro PPD responses in peripheral blood in the absence of TST reactivity, supporting exposure to and priming by environmental mycobacterial antigens. Group 2 were then vaccinated at 4(1/2) months of age and a repeat TST was performed at 20-28 months of age. Positive reactivity (>or=5 mm) was evident in 11.1% and 12.5% infants from Group 1 and Group 2 respectively suggesting that the timing of BCG vaccination had little effect by this age. We further assessed for immune correlates in peripheral blood at 4(1/2) months of age. Mycobacterial specific IFNgamma responses were greater in TST responders than in non-responders, although the size of induration did not correlate with IFNgamma. However the IFNgamma: IL-10 ratio positively correlated with TST induration suggesting that the relationship between PPD induced IFNgamma and IL-10 in the peripheral blood may be important in controlling TST reactivity. Collectively these data provide further insights into how the TST is regulated in early life, and how a positive response might be interpreted.",
        "The Trp(620) allotype of PTPN22 confers susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and certain other classical autoimmune diseases. There has been a report of other variants within the PTPN22 locus that alter risk of RA; protective haplotype '5', haplotype group '6-10' and susceptibility haplotype '4', suggesting the possibility of other PTPN22 variants involved in the pathogenesis of RA independent of R620W (rs2476601). Our aim was to further investigate this possibility.A total of 4,460 RA cases and 4,481 controls, all European, were analysed. Single nucleotide polymorphisms rs3789607, rs12144309, rs3811021 and rs12566340 were genotyped over New Zealand (NZ) and UK samples. Publically-available Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) genotype data were used.The protective effect of haplotype 5 was confirmed (rs3789607; (OR = 0.91, P = 0.016), and a second protective effect (possibly of haplotype 6) was observed (rs12144309; OR = 0.90, P = 0.021). The previously reported susceptibility effect of haplotype 4 was not replicated; instead a protective effect was observed (rs3811021; OR = 0.85, P = 1.4×10(-5)). Haplotypes defined by rs3789607, rs12144309 and rs3811021 coalesced with the major allele of rs12566340 within the adjacent BFK (B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family kin) gene. We, therefore, tested rs12566340 for association with RA conditional on rs2476601; there was no evidence for an independent effect at rs12566340 (P = 0.76). Similarly, there was no evidence for an independent effect at rs12566340 in type 1 diabetes (P = 0.85).We have no evidence for a common variant additional to rs2476601 within the PTPN22 locus that influences the risk of RA. Arg620Trp is almost certainly the single common causal variant.",
        "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants. The rate of decay of RSV-specific maternal antibodies (RSV-matAb), the factors affecting cord blood levels, and the relationship between these levels and protection from infection are poorly defined.A birth cohort (n = 635) in rural Kenya, was studied intensively to monitor infections and describe age-related serological characteristics. RSV specific IgG antibody (Ab) in serum was measured by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in cord blood, consecutive samples taken 3 monthly, and in paired acute and convalescent samples. A linear regression model was used to calculate the rate of RSV-matAb decline. The effect of risk factors on cord blood titres was investigated.The half-life of matAb in the Kenyan cohort was calculated to be 79 days (95% confidence limits (CL): 76-81 days). Ninety seven percent of infants were born with RSV-matAb. Infants who subsequently experienced an infection in early life had significantly lower cord titres of anti-RSV Ab in comparison to infants who did not have any incident infection in the first 6 months (P = 0.011). RSV infections were shown to have no effect on the rate of decay of RSV-matAb.Maternal-specific RSV Ab decline rapidly following birth. However, we provide evidence of protection against severe disease by RSV-matAb during the first 6-7 months. This suggests that boosting maternal-specific Ab by RSV vaccination may be a useful strategy to consider.",
        "Autism, a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder manifested by deficits in social behavior and interpersonal communication, and by stereotyped, repetitive behaviors, is inexplicably biased towards males by a ratio of ∼4∶1, with no clear understanding of whether or how the sex hormones may play a role in autism susceptibility. Here, we show that male and female hormones differentially regulate the expression of a novel autism candidate gene, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-alpha (RORA) in a neuronal cell line, SH-SY5Y. In addition, we demonstrate that RORA transcriptionally regulates aromatase, an enzyme that converts testosterone to estrogen. We further show that aromatase protein is significantly reduced in the frontal cortex of autistic subjects relative to sex- and age-matched controls, and is strongly correlated with RORA protein levels in the brain. These results indicate that RORA has the potential to be under both negative and positive feedback regulation by male and female hormones, respectively, through one of its transcriptional targets, aromatase, and further suggest a mechanism for introducing sex bias in autism.",
        "Serotonin signaling influences social behavior in both human and nonhuman primates. In humans, variation upstream of the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) has recently been shown to influence both behavioral measures of social anxiety and amygdala response to social threats. Here we show that length polymorphisms in 5-HTTLPR predict social reward and punishment in rhesus macaques, a species in which 5-HTTLPR variation is analogous to that of humans.In contrast to monkeys with two copies of the long allele (L/L), monkeys with one copy of the short allele of this gene (S/L) spent less time gazing at face than non-face images, less time looking in the eye region of faces, and had larger pupil diameters when gazing at photos of a high versus low status male macaques. Moreover, in a novel primed gambling task, presentation of photos of high status male macaques promoted risk-aversion in S/L monkeys but promoted risk-seeking in L/L monkeys. Finally, as measured by a \"pay-per-view\" task, S/L monkeys required juice payment to view photos of high status males, whereas L/L monkeys sacrificed fluid to see the same photos.These data indicate that genetic variation in serotonin function contributes to social reward and punishment in rhesus macaques, and thus shapes social behavior in humans and rhesus macaques alike.",
        "In this study, we analyze the importance of O-linked oligosaccharides present in peptidorhamnomannan (PRM) from the cell wall of the fungus Scedosporium prolificans for recognition and phagocytosis of conidia by macrophages. Adding PRM led to a dose-dependent inhibition of conidia phagocytosis, whereas de-O-glycosylated PRM did not show any effect. PRM induced the release of macrophage-derived antimicrobial compounds. However, O-linked oligosaccharides do not appear to be required for such induction. The effect of PRM on conidia-induced macrophage killing was examined using latex beads coated with PRM or de-O-glycosylated PRM. A decrease in macrophage viability similar to that caused by conidia was detected. However, macrophage killing was unaffected when beads coated with de-O-glycosylated PRM were used, indicating the toxic effect of O-linked oligosaccharides on macrophages. In addition, PRM triggered TNF-α release by macrophages. Chemical removal of O-linked oligosaccharides from PRM abolished cytokine induction, suggesting that the O-linked oligosaccharidic chains are important moieties involved in inflammatory responses through the induction of TNF-α secretion. In summary, we show that O-glycosylation plays a role in the recognition and uptake of S. prolificans by macrophages, killing of macrophages and production of pro- inflammatory cytokines.",
        "Various factors that are important for proper hearing have been identified, including serum levels of zinc. Here we investigated whether epigenetic regulatory pathways, which can be modified by environmental factors, could modulate hearing. RT-PCR detected expression of genes encoding DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase (Hdac) in the postnatal as well as adult mouse auditory epithelium. DBA/2J mice, which are a model for progressive hearing loss, were injected subcutaneously with one or a combination of the following reagents: <smallcaps>L</smallcaps>-methionine as a methyl donor, valproic acid as a pan-Hdac inhibitor, and folic acid and vitamin B12 as putative factors involved in age-related hearing loss. The mice were treated from ages 4 to 12 weeks (N ≥ 5), and auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds were measured at 8, 16, and 32 kHz. Treatment of the mice with a combination of <smallcaps>L</smallcaps>-methionine and valproic acid (M+V) significantly reduced the increase in the ABR threshold at 32 kHz. Treatment with any of these reagents individually produced no such effect. Microarray analyses detected 299 gene probes that were significantly up- or down-regulated in the cochleae of mice treated with M+V compared with the control vehicle-treated mice. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed significant up-regulation of a zinc importer gene, Zip4, in the cochleae of mice treated with M+V. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated an intense Zip4 signal in cochlear tissues such as the lateral wall, organ of Corti, and spiral ganglion. Finally, mice treated with the Zip4 inducer (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate showed a significant reduction in the increase of the ABR threshold at 32 kHz and up-regulation of Zip4 expression in the cochlea. This study suggests that epigenetic regulatory pathways can modify auditory function and that zinc intake in the cochlea via Zip4 mediates maintenance of mammalian hearing.",
        "Peatlands cover more than 30% of the Finnish land area and impact N2O fluxes. Denitrifiers release N2O as an intermediate or end product. In situ N2O emissions of a near pH neutral pristine fen soil in Finnish Lapland were marginal during gas chamber measurements. However, nitrate and ammonium fertilization significantly stimulated in situ N2O emissions. Stimulation with nitrate was stronger than with ammonium. N2O was produced and subsequently consumed in gas chambers. In unsupplemented anoxic microcosms, fen soil produced N2O only when acetylene was added to block nitrous oxide reductase, suggesting complete denitrification. Nitrate and nitrite stimulated denitrification in fen soil, and maximal reaction velocities (vmax) of nitrate or nitrite dependent denitrification where 18 and 52 nmol N2O h-1 gDW-1, respectively. N2O was below 30% of total produced N gases in fen soil when concentrations of nitrate and nitrite were <500 μM. vmax for N2O consumption was up to 36 nmol N2O h-1 gDW-1. Denitrifier diversity was assessed by analyses of narG, nirK/nirS, and nosZ (encoding nitrate-, nitrite-, and nitrous oxide reductases, respectively) by barcoded amplicon pyrosequencing. Analyses of ~14,000 quality filtered sequences indicated up to 25 species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and up to 359 OTUs at 97% sequence similarity, suggesting diverse denitrifiers. Phylogenetic analyses revealed clusters distantly related to publicly available sequences, suggesting hitherto unknown denitrifiers. Representatives of species-level OTUs were affiliated with sequences of unknown soil bacteria and Actinobacterial, Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Delta-Proteobacterial sequences. Comparison of the 4 gene markers at 97% similarity indicated a higher diversity of narG than for the other gene markers based on Shannon indices and observed number of OTUs. The collective data indicate (i) a high denitrification and N2O consumption potential, and (ii) a highly diverse, nitrate limited denitrifier community associated with potential N2O fluxes in a pH-neutral fen soil.",
        "Nymphalidae is the largest family of butterflies with their phylogenetic relationships not adequately approached to date. The mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of 11 new nymphalid species were reported and a comparative mitogenomic analysis was conducted together with other 22 available nymphalid mitogenomes. A phylogenetic analysis of the 33 species from all 13 currently recognized nymphalid subfamilies was done based on the mitogenomic data set with three Lycaenidae species as the outgroups. The mitogenome comparison showed that the eleven new mitogenomes were similar with those of other butterflies in gene content and order. The reconstructed phylogenetic trees reveal that the nymphalids are made up of five major clades (the nymphaline, heliconiine, satyrine, danaine and libytheine clades), with sister relationship between subfamilies Cyrestinae and Biblidinae, and most likely between subfamilies Morphinae and Satyrinae. This whole mitogenome-based phylogeny is generally congruent with those of former studies based on nuclear-gene and mitogenomic analyses, but differs considerably from the result of morphological cladistic analysis, such as the basal position of Libytheinae in morpho-phylogeny is not confirmed in molecular studies. However, we found that the mitogenomic phylogeny established herein is compatible with selected morphological characters (including developmental and adult morpho-characters).",
        "Describing patterns of connectivity among populations of species with widespread distributions is particularly important in understanding the ecology and evolution of marine species. In this study, we examined patterns of population differentiation, migration, and historical population dynamics using microsatellite and mitochondrial loci to test whether populations of the epinephelid fish, Gag, Mycteroperca microlepis, an important fishery species, are genetically connected across the Gulf of Mexico and if so, whether that connectivity is attributable to either contemporary or historical processes. Populations of Gag on the Campeche Bank and the West Florida Shelf show significant, but low magnitude, differentiation. Time since divergence/expansion estimates associated with historical population dynamics indicate that any population or spatial expansions indicated by population genetics would have likely occurred in the late Pleistocene. Using coalescent-based approaches, we find that the best model for explaining observed spatial patterns of contemporary genetic variation is one of asymmetric gene flow, with movement from Campeche Bank to the West Florida Shelf. Both estimated migration rates and ecological data support the hypothesis that Gag populations throughout the Gulf of Mexico are connected via present day larval dispersal. Demonstrating this greatly expanded scale of connectivity for Gag highlights the influence of \"ghost\" populations (sensu Beerli) on genetic patterns and presents a critical consideration for both fisheries management and conservation of this and other species with similar genetic patterns.",
        "We present a general approach in 1H-detected 13C solid-state NMR (SSNMR) for side-chain signal assignments of 10-50 nmol quantities of proteins using a combination of a high magnetic field, ultra-fast magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ~80 kHz, and stereo-array-isotope-labeled (SAIL) proteins [Kainosho M. et al., Nature 440, 52-57, 2006]. First, we demonstrate that 1H indirect detection improves the sensitivity and resolution of 13C SSNMR of SAIL proteins for side-chain assignments in the ultra-fast MAS condition. 1H-detected SSNMR was performed for micro-crystalline ubiquitin (~55 nmol or ~0.5mg) that was SAIL-labeled at seven isoleucine (Ile) residues. Sensitivity was dramatically improved by 1H-detected 2D 1H/13C SSNMR by factors of 5.4-9.7 and 2.1-5.0, respectively, over 13C-detected 2D 1H/13C SSNMR and 1D 13C CPMAS, demonstrating that 2D 1H-detected SSNMR offers not only additional resolution but also sensitivity advantage over 1D 13C detection for the first time. High 1H resolution for the SAIL-labeled side-chain residues offered reasonable resolution even in the 2D data. A 1H-detected 3D 13C/13C/1H experiment on SAIL-ubiquitin provided nearly complete 1H and 13C assignments for seven Ile residues only within ~2.5 h. The results demonstrate the feasibility of side-chain signal assignment in this approach for as little as 10 nmol of a protein sample within ~3 days. The approach is likely applicable to a variety of proteins of biological interest without any requirements of highly efficient protein expression systems.",
        "Clinical studies have shown that Medically Unexplained Symptoms (MUS) are related to common mental disorders. It is unknown how often common mental disorders occur in subjects who have explained physical symptoms (PHY), MUS or both, in the general population, what the incidence rates are, and whether there is a difference between PHY and MUS in this respect.To study the prevalence and incidence rates of mood, anxiety and substance use disorders in groups with PHY, MUS and combined MUS and PHY compared to a no-symptoms reference group in the general population.Data were derived from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 (NEMESIS-2), a nationally representative face-to-face survey of the general population aged 18-64 years. We selected subjects with explained physical symptoms only (n=1952), with MUS only (n=177), with both MUS and PHY (n=209), and a reference group with no physical symptoms (n=4168). The assessment of common mental disorders was through the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between group membership and the prevalence and first-incidence rates of comorbid mental disorders, adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics.MUS were associated with the highest prevalence rates of mood and anxiety disorders, and combined MUS and PHY with the highest prevalence rates of substance disorder. Combined MUS and PHY were associated with a higher incidence rate of mood disorder only (OR 2.9 (95%CI:1.27,6.74)).In the general population, PHY, MUS and the combination of both are related to mood and anxiety disorder, but odds are highest for combined MUS and PHY in relation to substance use disorder. Combined MUS and PHY are related to a greater incidence of mood disorder. These findings warrant further research into possibilities to improve recognition and early intervention in subjects with combined MUS and PHY.",
        "Macaranga myrmecophytes (ant-plants) are generally well protected from herbivore attacks by their symbiotic ants (plant-ants). However, larvae of Arhopala (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) species survive and develop on specific Macaranga ant-plant species without being attacked by the plant-ants of their host species. We hypothesized that Arhopala larvae chemically mimic or camouflage themselves with the ants on their host plant so that the larvae are accepted by the plant-ant species of their host. Chemical analyses of cuticular hydrocarbons showed that chemical congruency varied among Arhopala species; A. dajagaka matched well the host plant-ants, A. amphimuta did not match, and unexpectedly, A. zylda lacked hydrocarbons. Behaviorally, the larvae and dummies coated with cuticular chemicals of A. dajagaka were well attended by the plant-ants, especially by those of the host. A. amphimuta was often attacked by all plant-ants except for the host plant-ants toward the larvae, and those of A. zylda were ignored by all plant-ants. Our results suggested that conspicuous variations exist in the chemical strategies used by the myrmecophilous butterflies that allow them to avoid ant attack and be accepted by the plant-ant colonies.",
        "Airway microbiota composition has been clearly correlated with many pulmonary diseases, and notably with cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal genetic disorder caused by mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Recently, a new molecule, ivacaftor, has been shown to re-establish the functionality of the G551D-mutated CFTR, allowing significant improvement in lung function.The purpose of this study was to follow the evolution of the airway microbiota in CF patients treated with ivacaftor, using quantitative PCR and pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons, in order to identify quantitative and qualitative changes in bacterial communities. Three G551D children were followed up longitudinally over a mean period of more than one year covering several months before and after initiation of ivacaftor treatment.129 operational taxonomy units (OTUs), representing 64 genera, were identified. There was no significant difference in total bacterial load before and after treatment. Comparison of global community composition found no significant changes in microbiota. Two OTUs, however, showed contrasting dynamics: after initiation of ivacaftor, the relative abundance of the anaerobe Porphyromonas 1 increased (p<0.01) and that of Streptococcus 1 (S. mitis group) decreased (p<0.05), possibly in relation to the anti-Gram-positive properties of ivacaftor. The anaerobe Prevotella 2 correlated positively with the pulmonary function test FEV-1 (r=0.73, p<0.05). The study confirmed the presumed positive role of anaerobes in lung function.Several airway microbiota components, notably anaerobes (obligate or facultative anaerobes), could be valuable biomarkers of lung function improvement under ivacaftor, and could shed light on the pathophysiology of lung disease in CF patients.",
        "Predation and hunter harvest constitute the main mortality factors affecting the size and dynamics of many exploited populations. The re-colonization by wolves (Canis lupus) of the Scandinavian Peninsula may therefore substantially reduce hunter harvest of moose (Alces alces), the main prey of wolves.We examined possible effects of wolf presence on hunter harvest in areas where we had data before and after wolf establishment (n = 25), and in additional areas that had been continuously exposed to wolf predation during at least ten years (n = 43). There was a general reduction in the total number of moose harvested (n = 31,827) during the ten year study period in all areas irrespective of presence of wolves or not. However, the reduction in hunter harvest was stronger within wolf territories compared to control areas without wolves. The reduction in harvest was larger in small (500-800 km2) compared to large (1,200-1,800 km2) wolf territories. In areas with newly established wolf territories moose management appeared to be adaptive with regard to both managers (hunting quotas) and to hunters (actual harvest). In these areas an instant reduction in moose harvest over-compensated the estimated number of moose killed annually by wolves and the composition of the hunted animals changed towards a lower proportion of adult females.We show that the re-colonization of wolves may result in an almost instant functional response by another large predator-humans-that reduced the potential for a direct numerical effect on the density of wolves' main prey, the moose. Because most of the worlds' habitat that will be available for future colonization by large predators are likely to be strongly influenced by humans, human behavioural responses may constitute a key trait that govern the impact of large predators on their prey.",
        "As a fundamental characteristic of soil physical properties, the soil Particle Size Distribution (PSD) is important in the research on soil moisture migration, solution transformation, and soil erosion. In this research, the PSD characteristics with distinct methods in different land uses are analyzed. The results show that the upper bound of the volume domain of the clay domain ranges from 5.743 μm to 5.749 μm for all land-use types. For the silt domain of purple soil, the value ranges among 286.852~286.966 μm. For all purple soil land-use types, the order of the volume domain fractal dimensions is D clay<D silt<D sand. However, the values of D silt and D sand in the Pinus massoniana Lamb, Robinia pseudoacacia L and Ipomoea batatas are all higher than the corresponding values in the Citrus reticulate Blanco and Setaria viridis. Moreover, in all the land-use types, all of the parameters in volume domain fractal dimension (Dvi) are higher than the corresponding parameter values from the United States Department of Agriculture (Dvi(U)). The correlation study between the volume domain fractal dimension and the soil properties shows that the intensity of correlation to the soil texture and soil organic matter has the order as: D silt>D silt(U)>D sand (U)>D sand and D silt>D silt(U)>D sand>D sand(U), respectively. As it is compared with all Dvi, the D silt has the most significant correlativity to the soil texture and organic matter in different land uses of the typical purple soil watersheds. Therefore, Dsilt will be a potential indictor for evaluating the proportion of fine particles in the PSD, as well as a key measurement in soil quality and productivity studies.",
        "To evaluate the clinical treatment effects of orthokeratology to slow the progression of myopia.Several well-designed controlled studies have investigated the effects of orthokeratology in school-aged children. We conducted this meta-analysis to better evaluate the existing evidence. Relevant studies were identified in the Medline and Embase database without language limitations. The main outcomes included axial length and vitreous chamber depth reported as the mean ± standard deviation. The results were pooled and assessed with a fixed-effects model analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed according to geographical location and study design.Of the seven eligible studies, all reported axial length changes after 2 years, while two studies reported vitreous chamber depth changes. The pooled estimates indicated that change in axial length in the ortho-k group was 0.27 mm (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.22, 0.32) less than the control group. Myopic progression was reduced by approximately 45%. The combined results revealed that the difference in vitreous chamber depth between the two groups was 0.22 mm (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.14, 0.31). None of the studies reported severe adverse events.The overall findings suggest that ortho-k can slow myopia progression in school-aged children.",
        "Inter-personal synchronization is important for performing many cooperative tasks. Notably, synchrony has also been shown to have considerable positive social influences, possibly mediated by synchrony-induced changes in social attitude such as an increased sense of similarity and affiliation between interacting individuals. This effect has been demonstrated in adults, but it is unknown whether synchrony might have a similar impact on the social attitudes of children. We thus set to directly examine the influence of synchronous rhythmic interaction on perceived similarity and closeness in pairs of 8-9 year old children. We found that children who had participated in a synchronous interaction regarded their interacting partner as more similar and closer to themselves than children who had not interacted at all or who had taken part in an asynchronous interaction. These findings reveal that synchronous interaction can positively alter social attitudes between interacting children, suggesting a potential mechanism by which synchrony may enhance positive social interaction through attitudinal shift.",
        "A possible mechanistic pathway related to an enzyme-catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition reaction was studied by theoretical calculations at density functional (B3LYP, O3LYP, M062X) and semiempirical levels (PM6-DH2, PM6) performed on a model system. The calculations were carried out for the key [4+2] cycloaddition step considering enzyme-catalyzed biosynthesis of Spinosyn A in a model reaction, where a reliable example of a biological Diels-Alder reaction was reported experimentally. In the present study it was demonstrated that the [4+2] cycloaddition reaction may benefit from moving along the energetically balanced reaction coordinate, which enabled the catalytic rate enhancement of the [4+2] cycloaddition pathway involving a single transition state. Modeling of such a system with coordination of three amino acids indicated a reliable decrease of activation energy by ~18.0 kcal/mol as compared to a non-catalytic transformation.",
        "The prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) is higher in those with low levels of educational attainment, the unemployed and those with low social status. However the extent to which these factors cause MDD is unclear. Most of the available data comes from studies in developed countries, and these findings may not extrapolate to developing countries. Examining the relationship between MDD and socio economic status in China is likely to add to the debate because of the radical economic and social changes occurring in China over the last 30 years.We report results from 3,639 Chinese women with recurrent MDD and 3,800 controls. Highly significant odds ratios (ORs) were observed between MDD and full time employment (OR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.25-0.46, logP = 78), social status (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.77-0.87, logP = 13.3) and education attainment (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.86-0.90, logP = 6.8). We found a monotonic relationship between increasing age and increasing levels of educational attainment. Those with only primary school education have significantly more episodes of MDD (mean 6.5, P-value = 0.009) and have a clinically more severe disorder, while those with higher educational attainment are likely to manifest more comorbid anxiety disorders.In China lower socioeconomic position is associated with increased rates of MDD, as it is elsewhere in the world. Significantly more episodes of MDD occur among those with lower educational attainment (rather than longer episodes of disease), consistent with the hypothesis that the lower socioeconomic position increases the likelihood of developing MDD. The phenomenology of MDD varies according to the degree of educational attainment: higher educational attainment not only appears to protect against MDD but alters its presentation, to a more anxious phenotype.",
        "The relationship between loss-to-follow-up (LTFU) in HIV treatment and care programmes and psychosocial factors, including self-reported stigma, is important to understand. This prospective cohort study explored stigma and LTFU in treatment eligible adults who had yet not started antiretroviral therapy (ART).Psychosocial, clinical and demographic data were collected at a baseline interview. Self-reported stigma was measured with a multi-item scale. LTFU was defined as not attending clinic in the 90 days since last appointment or before death. Data was collected between January 2009 and January 2013 and analysed using Cox Regression.380 individuals were recruited (median time in study 3.35 years, total time at risk 1065.81 person-years). 203 were retained (53.4%), 109 were LTFU (28.7%), 48 had died and were not LTFU at death (12.6%) and 20 had transferred out (5.3%). The LTFU rate was 10.65 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 8.48-12.34). 362 individuals (95.3%) started ART. Stigma total score (categorised in quartiles) was not significantly associated with LTFU in either univariable or multivariable analysis (adjusting for other variables in the final model): second quartile aHR 0.77 (95%CI: 0.41-1.46), third quartile aHR 1.20(95%CI: 0.721-2.04), fourth quartile aHR 0.62 (95%CI: 0.35-1.11). In the final multivariable model, higher LTFU rates were associated with male gender, increased openness with friends/family and believing that community problems would be solved at higher levels. Lower LTFU rates were independently associated with increased year of age, greater reliance on family/friends, and having children.Demographic and other psychosocial factors were more closely related to LTFU than self-reported stigma. This may be consistent with high levels of social exposure to HIV and ART and with stigma affecting LTFU less than other stages of care. Research and clinical implications are discussed.",
        "Reliable and valid biomarkers of ageing (BoA) are needed to understand mechanisms, test interventions and predict the timing of adverse health events associated with ageing. Since increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial dysfunction are consequences of cellular senescence and may contribute causally to the ageing of organisms, we focused on these parameters as candidate BoA. Superoxide levels, mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and subpopulations (lymphocytes and monocytes) were measured in participants from the Newcastle 85+ study, a population-based study of the very old (aged 85 years and older). The intra- and inter-assay precision expressed as coefficient of variation (CV) for all parameters was acceptable (3% to 12% and 5 to 22% respectively). All parameters were stable in the short-term (1 week interval) in a sample of control individuals in the PBMCs and lymphocyte subpopulation, however they were unstable in the monocyte subpopulation; this rendered monocytes unreliable for further analysis. There was a significant association between superoxide levels and mitochondrial mass (positive in lymphocytes, p = 0.01) and between superoxide levels and mitochondrial membrane potential (negative in PBMCs, p = 0.01; positive in lymphocytes, p = 0.05). There were also significant associations between superoxide levels and mitochondrial parameters with other markers of oxidative stress-induced cellular senescence (p≤0.04), however some were in the opposite direction to expected. No associations were found between the measured parameters and age-related outcomes, including cognitive impairment, disability, co-morbidity and survival - questioning the validity of these parameters as candidate BoA in the very old.",
        "TDP-43 is found in cytoplasmic inclusions in 95% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 60% of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Approximately 4% of familial ALS is caused by mutations in TDP-43. The majority of these mutations are found in the glycine-rich domain, including the variant M337V, which is one of the most common mutations in TDP-43. In order to investigate the use of allele-specific RNA interference (RNAi) as a potential therapeutic tool, we designed and screened a set of siRNAs that specifically target TDP-43(M337V) mutation. Two siRNA specifically silenced the M337V mutation in HEK293T cells transfected with GFP-TDP-43(wt) or GFP-TDP-43(M337V) or TDP-43 C-terminal fragments counterparts. C-terminal TDP-43 transfected cells show an increase of cytosolic inclusions, which are decreased after allele-specific siRNA in M337V cells. We then investigated the effects of one of these allele-specific siRNAs in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from an ALS patient carrying the M337V mutation. These lines showed a two-fold increase in cytosolic TDP-43 compared to the control. Following transfection with the allele-specific siRNA, cytosolic TDP-43 was reduced by 30% compared to cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA. We conclude that RNA interference can be used to selectively target the TDP-43(M337V) allele in mammalian and patient cells, thus demonstrating the potential for using RNA interference as a therapeutic tool for ALS.",
        "BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor that is over-expressed due to chromosomal translocations, or other abnormalities, in ∼40% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. BCL6 interacts with co-repressor, SMRT, and this is essential for its role in lymphomas. Peptide or small molecule inhibitors, which prevent the association of SMRT with BCL6, inhibit transcriptional repression and cause apoptosis of lymphoma cells in vitro and in vivo. In order to discover compounds, which have the potential to be developed into BCL6 inhibitors, we screened a natural product library. The ansamycin antibiotic, rifamycin SV, inhibited BCL6 transcriptional repression and NMR spectroscopy confirmed a direct interaction between rifamycin SV and BCL6. To further determine the characteristics of compounds binding to BCL6-POZ we analyzed four other members of this family and showed that rifabutin, bound most strongly. An X-ray crystal structure of the rifabutin-BCL6 complex revealed that rifabutin occupies a partly non-polar pocket making interactions with tyrosine58, asparagine21 and arginine24 of the BCL6-POZ domain. Importantly these residues are also important for the interaction of BLC6 with SMRT. This work demonstrates a unique approach to developing a structure activity relationship for a compound that will form the basis of a therapeutically useful BCL6 inhibitor.",
        "SDF-1/CXCR4 signalling plays an important role in neuronal cell migration and brain development. However, the impact of CXCR4 deficiency in the postnatal mouse brain is still poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate the importance of CXCR4 on cerebellar development and motor behaviour by conditional inactivation of Cxcr4 in the central nervous system. We found CXCR4 plays a key role in cerebellar development. Its loss leads to defects in Purkinje cell dentritogenesis and axonal projection in vivo but not in cell culture. Transcriptome analysis revealed the most significantly affected pathways in the Cxcr4 deficient developing cerebellum are involved in extra cellular matrix receptor interactions and focal adhesion. Consistent with functional impairment of the cerebellum, Cxcr4 knockout mice have poor coordination and balance performance in skilled motor tests. Together, these results suggest ectopic the migration of granule cells impairs development of Purkinje cells, causes gross cerebellar anatomical disruption and leads to behavioural motor defects in Cxcr4 null mice.",
        "Neurofeedback based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a new approach that allows training of voluntary control over regionally specific brain activity. However, the neural basis of successful neurofeedback learning remains poorly understood. Here, we assessed changes in effective brain connectivity associated with neurofeedback training of visual cortex activity. Using dynamic causal modeling (DCM), we found that training participants to increase visual cortex activity was associated with increased effective connectivity between the visual cortex and the superior parietal lobe. Specifically, participants who learned to control activity in their visual cortex showed increased top-down control of the superior parietal lobe over the visual cortex, and at the same time reduced bottom-up processing. These results are consistent with efficient employment of top-down visual attention and imagery, which were the cognitive strategies used by participants to increase their visual cortex activity.",
        "Wolbachia bacteria are common endosymbionts of insects, and some strains are known to protect their hosts against RNA viruses and other parasites. This has led to the suggestion that releasing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes could prevent the transmission of arboviruses and other human parasites. We have identified Wolbachia in Kenyan populations of the yellow fever vector Aedes bromeliae and its relative Aedes metallicus, and in Mansonia uniformis and Mansonia africana, which are vectors of lymphatic filariasis. These Wolbachia strains cluster together on the bacterial phylogeny, and belong to bacterial clades that have recombined with other unrelated strains. These new Wolbachia strains may be affecting disease transmission rates of infected mosquito species, and could be transferred into other mosquito vectors as part of control programs.",
        "In sub-Saharan Africa, early mortality is high following initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We investigated 6-month outcomes and factors associated with mortality in HIV-infected adults being assessed for ART initiation and presenting with weight loss, chronic fever or diarrhea, and with negative TB sputum microscopy.A prospective cohort study was conducted in Malawi, investigating mortality in relation to ART uptake, microbiological findings and treatment of opportunistic infection (OIs), 6 months after meeting ART eligibility criteria.Of 469 consecutive adults eligible for ART, 74(16%) died within 6 months of enrolment, at a median of 41 days (IQR 20-81). 370(79%) started ART at a median time of 18 days (IQR 7-40) after enrolment. Six-month case-fatality rates were higher in patients with OIs; 25/121(21%) in confirmed/clinical TB and 10/50(20%) with blood stream infection (BSI) compared to 41/308(13%) in patients with no infection identified. Median TB treatment start was 27 days (IQR 17-65) after enrolment and mortality [8 deaths (44%)] was significantly higher among 18 culture-positive patients with delayed TB diagnosis compared to patients diagnosed clinically and treated promptly with subsequent culture confirmation [6/34 (18%);p = 0.04]. Adjusted multivariable analysis, excluding deaths in the first 21 days, showed weight loss >10%, low CD4 count, severe anemia, laboratory-only TB diagnosis, and not initiating ART to be independently associated with increased risk of death.Mortality remains high among chronically ill patients eligible for ART. Prompt initiation of ART is vital: more than half of deaths were among patients who never started ART. Diagnostic and treatment delay for TB was strongly associated with risk of death. More than half of deaths occurred without identification of a specific infection. ART programmes need access to rapid point-of-care-diagnostic tools for OIs. The role of early empiric OI treatment in this population requires further evaluation in clinical trials.",
        "Originally the novel protein Blom7α was identified as novel pre-mRNA splicing factor that interacts with SNEV(Prp19/Pso4), an essential protein involved in extension of human endothelial cell life span, DNA damage repair, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and pre-mRNA splicing. Blom7α belongs to the heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein K homology (KH) protein family, displaying 2 KH domains, a well conserved and widespread RNA-binding motif. In order to identify specific sequence binding motifs, we here used Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) with a synthetic RNA library. Besides sequence motifs like (U/A)(1-4) C(2-6) (U/A)(1-5), we identified an AC-rich RNA-aptamer that we termed AK48 (Aptamer KH-binding 48), binding to Blom7α with high affinity. Addition of AK48 to pre-mRNA splicing reactions in vitro inhibited the formation of mature spliced mRNA and led to a slight accumulation of the H complex of the spliceosome. These results suggest that the RNA binding activity of Blom7α might be required for pre-mRNA splicing catalysis. The inhibition of in-vitro splicing by the small RNA AK48 indicates the potential use of small RNA molecules in targeting the spliceosome complex as a novel target for drug development.",
        "This paper introduces a model of oculomotor control during the smooth pursuit of occluded visual targets. This model is based upon active inference, in which subjects try to minimise their (proprioceptive) prediction error based upon posterior beliefs about the hidden causes of their (exteroceptive) sensory input. Our model appeals to a single principle--the minimisation of variational free energy--to provide Bayes optimal solutions to the smooth pursuit problem. However, it tries to accommodate the cardinal features of smooth pursuit of partially occluded targets that have been observed empirically in normal subjects and schizophrenia. Specifically, we account for the ability of normal subjects to anticipate periodic target trajectories and emit pre-emptive smooth pursuit eye movements--prior to the emergence of a target from behind an occluder. Furthermore, we show that a single deficit in the postsynaptic gain of prediction error units (encoding the precision of posterior beliefs) can account for several features of smooth pursuit in schizophrenia: namely, a reduction in motor gain and anticipatory eye movements during visual occlusion, a paradoxical improvement in tracking unpredicted deviations from target trajectories and a failure to recognise and exploit regularities in the periodic motion of visual targets. This model will form the basis of subsequent (dynamic causal) models of empirical eye tracking measurements, which we hope to validate, using psychopharmacology and studies of schizophrenia.",
        "Children with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) represent a huge reservoir for future disease. We wished to determine Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection prevalence among BCG-immunised five-year-old children in Entebbe, Uganda, but there are limited data on the performance of immunoassays for diagnosis of tuberculosis infection in children in endemic settings. We therefore evaluated agreement between a commercial interferon gamma release assay (T-SPOT.TB) and the tuberculin skin test (TST; 2 units RT-23 tuberculin; positive defined as diameter ≥10 mm), along with the reproducibility of T-SPOT.TB on short-term follow-up, in this population.We recruited 907 children of which 56 were household contacts of TB patients. They were tested with T-SPOT.TB at age five years and then re-examined with T-SPOT.TB (n = 405) and TST (n = 319) approximately three weeks later. The principal outcome measures were T-SPOT.TB and TST positivity. At five years, 88 (9.7%) children tested positive by T-SPOT.TB. More than half of those that were T-SPOT.TB positive at five years were negative at follow-up, whereas 96% of baseline negatives were consistently negative. We observed somewhat better agreement between initial and follow-up T-SPOT.TB results among household TB contacts (κ = 0.77) than among non-contacts (κ = 0.39). Agreement between T-SPOT.TB and TST was weak (κ = 0.28 and κ = 0.40 for T-SPOT.TB at 5 years and follow-up, respectively). Of 28 children who were positive on both T-SPOT.TB tests, 14 (50%) had a negative TST. Analysis of spot counts showed high levels of instability in responses between baseline and follow-up, indicating variability in circulating numbers of T cells specific for certain M.tb antigens.We found that T-SPOT.TB positives are unstable over a three-week follow-up interval, and that TST compares poorly with T-SPOT.TB, making the categorisation of children as TB-infected or TB-uninfected difficult. Existing tools for the diagnosis of TB infection are unsatisfactory in determining infection among children in this setting.",
        "Severe malaria (SM) is a major cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa. Identification of both specific and sensitive clinical features to predict death is needed to improve clinical management.A 13-year observational study was conducted from 1997 through 2009 of 2,901 children with SM enrolled at the Royal Victoria Teaching Hospital in The Gambia to identify sensitive and specific predictors of poor outcome in Gambian children with severe malaria between the ages 4 months to 14 years. We have measured the sensitivity and specificity of clinical features that predict death or development of neurological sequelae.Impaired consciousness (odds ratio {OR} 4.4 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.7-7.3]), respiratory distress (OR 2.4 [95%CI, 1.7-3.2]), hypoglycemia (OR 1.7 [95%CI, 1.2-2.3]), jaundice (OR 1.9 [95%CI, 1.2-2.9]) and renal failure (OR 11.1 [95%CI, 3.3-36.5]) were independently associated with death in children with SM. The clinical features that showed the highest sensitivity and specificity to predict death were respiratory distress (area under the curve 0.63 [95%CI, 0.60-0.65]) and impaired consciousness (AUC 0.61[95%CI, 0.59-0.63]), which were comparable to the ability of hyperlactatemia (blood lactate>5 mM) to predict death (AUC 0.64 [95%CI, 0.55-0.72]). A Blantyre coma score (BCS) of 2 or less had a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 67% to predict death (AUC 0.70 [95% C.I. 0.68-0.72]), and sensitivity and specificity of 74% and 69%, respectively to predict development of neurological sequelae (AUC 0.72 [95% CI, 0.67-0.76]).The specificity of this BCS threshold to identify children at risk of dying improved in children less than 3 years of age (AUC 0.74, [95% C.I 0.71-0.76]).The BCS is a quantitative predictor of death. A BCS of 2 or less is the most sensitive and specific clinical feature to predict death or development of neurological sequelae in children with SM.",
        "Previous research suggested that structural and functional abnormalities within the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex contribute to the pathophysiology of Conduct Disorder (CD). Here, we investigated whether the integrity of the white-matter pathways connecting these regions is abnormal and thus may represent a putative neurobiological marker for CD.Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) was used to investigate white-matter microstructural integrity in male adolescents with childhood-onset CD, compared with healthy controls matched in age, sex, intelligence, and socioeconomic status. Two approaches were employed to analyze DTI data: voxel-based morphometry of fractional anisotropy (FA), an index of white-matter integrity, and virtual dissection of white-matter pathways using tractography.Adolescents with CD displayed higher FA within the right external capsule relative to controls (T = 6.08, P<0.05, Family-Wise Error, whole-brain correction). Tractography analyses showed that FA values within the uncinate fascicle (connecting the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex) were abnormally increased in individuals with CD relative to controls. This was in contrast with the inferior frontal-occipital fascicle, which showed no significant group differences in FA. The finding of increased FA in the uncinate fascicle remained significant when factoring out the contribution of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms. There were no group differences in the number of streamlines in either of these anatomical tracts.These results provide evidence that CD is associated with white-matter microstructural abnormalities in the anatomical tract that connects the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, the uncinate fascicle. These results implicate abnormal maturation of white-matter pathways which are fundamental in the regulation of emotional behavior in CD.",
        "Current influenza vaccines have reduced immunogenicity and are of uncertain efficacy in older adults. We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of MVA-NP+M1, a viral-vectored influenza vaccine designed to boost memory T cell responses, in a group of older adults.Thirty volunteers (aged 50-85) received a single intramuscular injection of MVA-NP+M1 at a dose of 1·5×10(8) plaque forming units (pfu). Safety and immunogenicity were assessed over a period of one year. The frequency of T cells specific for nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein 1 (M1) was determined by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) ELISpot, and their phenotypic and functional properties were characterized by polychromatic flow cytometry. In a subset of M1-specific CD8(+) T cells, T cell receptor (TCR) gene expression was evaluated using an unbiased molecular approach.Vaccination with MVA-NP+M1 was well tolerated. ELISpot responses were boosted significantly above baseline following vaccination. Increases were detected in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell subsets. Clonality studies indicated that MVA-NP+M1 expanded pre-existing memory CD8(+) T cells, which displayed a predominant CD27(+)CD45RO(+)CD57(-)CCR7(-) phenotype both before and after vaccination.MVA-NP+M1 is safe and immunogenic in older adults. Unlike seasonal influenza vaccination, the immune responses generated by MVA-NP+M1 are similar between younger and older individuals. A T cell-inducing vaccine such as MVA-NP+M1 may therefore provide a way to circumvent the immunosenescence that impairs routine influenza vaccination.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00942071.",
        "Vitamin B-12 is essential for the development and maintenance of a healthy nervous system. Brain development occurs primarily in utero and early infancy, but the role of maternal vitamin B-12 status during pregnancy on offspring cognitive function is unclear. In this study we assessed the effect of vitamin B-12 status in well-nourished pregnant women on the cognitive ability of their offspring in a UK birth cohort (ALSPAC). We then examined the association of SNPs in maternal genes FUT2 (rs492602) and TCN2 (rs1801198, rs9606756) that are related to plasma vitamin B-12, with offspring IQ. Observationally, there was a positive association between maternal vitamin B-12 intake and child's IQ that was markedly attenuated after adjustment for potential confounders (mean difference in offspring IQ score per doubling of maternal B-12 intake, before adjustment: 2.0 (95% CI 1.3, 2.8); after adjustment: 0.7 (95% CI -0.04, 1.4)). Maternal FUT2 was weakly associated with offspring IQ: mean difference in IQ per allele was 0.9 (95% CI 0.1, 1.6). The expected effect of maternal vitamin B-12 on offspring IQ, given the relationships between SNPs and vitamin B-12, and SNPs and IQ was consistent with the observational result. Our findings suggest that maternal vitamin B-12 may not have an important effect on offspring cognitive ability. However, further examination of this issue is warranted.",
        "Bradykinesia is a cardinal feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite its disabling impact, the precise cause of this symptom remains elusive. Recent thinking suggests that bradykinesia may be more than simply a manifestation of motor slowness, and may in part reflect a specific deficit in the operation of motivational vigour in the striatum. In this paper we test the hypothesis that movement time in PD can be modulated by the specific nature of the motivational salience of possible action-outcomes.We developed a novel movement time paradigm involving winnable rewards and avoidable painful electrical stimuli. The faster the subjects performed an action the more likely they were to win money (in appetitive blocks) or to avoid a painful shock (in aversive blocks). We compared PD patients when OFF dopaminergic medication with controls. Our key finding is that PD patients OFF dopaminergic medication move faster to avoid aversive outcomes (painful electric shocks) than to reap rewarding outcomes (winning money) and, unlike controls, do not speed up in the current trial having failed to win money in the previous one. We also demonstrate that sensitivity to distracting stimuli is valence specific.We suggest this pattern of results can be explained in terms of low dopamine levels in the Parkinsonian state leading to an insensitivity to appetitive outcomes, and thus an inability to modulate movement speed in the face of rewards. By comparison, sensitivity to aversive stimuli is relatively spared. Our findings point to a rarely described property of bradykinesia in PD, namely its selective regulation by everyday outcomes.",
        "Control and elimination of malaria still represents a major public health challenge. Emerging parasite resistance to current therapies urges development of antimalarials with novel mechanism of action. Phospholipid biosynthesis of the Plasmodium parasite has been validated as promising candidate antimalarial target. The most prevalent de novo pathway for synthesis of phosphatidylcholine is the Kennedy pathway. Its regulatory and often also rate limiting step is catalyzed by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT). The CHO-MT58 cell line expresses a mutant variant of CCT, and displays a thermo-sensitive phenotype. At non-permissive temperature (40°C), the endogenous CCT activity decreases dramatically, blocking membrane synthesis and ultimately leading to apoptosis. In the present study we investigated the impact of the analogous mutation in a catalytic domain construct of Plasmodium falciparum CCT in order to explore the underlying molecular mechanism that explains this phenotype. We used temperature dependent enzyme activity measurements and modeling to investigate the functionality of the mutant enzyme. Furthermore, MS measurements were performed to determine the oligomerization state of the protein, and MD simulations to assess the inter-subunit interactions in the dimer. Our results demonstrate that the R681H mutation does not directly influence enzyme catalytic activity. Instead, it provokes increased heat-sensitivity by destabilizing the CCT dimer. This can possibly explain the significance of the PfCCT pseudoheterodimer organization in ensuring proper enzymatic function. This also provide an explanation for the observed thermo-sensitive phenotype of CHO-MT58 cell line.",
        "We developed an immunochromatography-based assay for detecting antibodies against recombinant α-galactosidase A proteins in serum. The evaluation of 29 serum samples from Fabry patients, who had received enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase alpha and/or agalsidase beta, was performed by means of this assay method, and the results clearly revealed that the patients exhibited the same level of antibodies against both agalsidase alpha and agalsidase beta, regardless of the species of recombinant α-galactosidase A used for enzyme replacement therapy. A conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay supported the results. Considering these, enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase alpha or agalsidase beta would generate antibodies against the common epitopes in both agalsidase alpha and agalsidase beta. Most of the patients who showed immunopositive reaction exhibited classic Fabry phenotype and harbored gene mutations affecting biosynthesis of α-galactosidase A. As immunochromatography is a handy and simple assay system which can be available at bedside, this assay method would be extremely useful for quick evaluation or first screening of serum antibodies against agalsidase alpha or agalsidase beta in Fabry disease with enzyme replacement therapy.",
        "Despite being the agent of life-threatening meningitis, Neisseria meningitidis is usually carried asymptomatically in the nasopharynx of humans and only occasionally causes disease. The genetic bases for virulence have not been entirely elucidated and the search for new virulence factors in this species is hampered by the lack of an animal model representative of the human disease. As an alternative strategy we employ a molecular epidemiological approach to establish a statistical association of a candidate virulence gene with disease in the human population. We examine the distribution of a previously-identified genetic element, a temperate bacteriophage, in 1288 meningococci isolated from cases of disease and asymptomatic carriage. The phage was over-represented in disease isolates from young adults indicating that it may contribute to invasive disease in this age group. Further statistical analysis indicated that between 20% and 45% of the pathogenic potential of the five most common disease-causing meningococcal groups was linked to the presence of the phage. In the absence of an animal model of human disease, this molecular epidemiological approach permitted the estimation of the influence of the candidate virulence factor. Such an approach is particularly valuable in the investigation of exclusively human diseases.",
        "The genetic basis of haemorrhagic stroke has proved difficult to unravel, partly hampered by the small numbers of subjects in any single study. A meta-analysis of all candidate gene association studies of haemorrhagic stroke (including ruptured subarachnoid haemorrhage and amyloid angiopathy-related haemorrhage) was performed, allowing more reliable estimates of risk.A systematic review and meta-analysis of all genetic studies in haemorrhagic stroke was conducted. Electronic databases were searched until and including March 2007 for any candidate gene in haemorrhagic stroke. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined for each gene disease association using fixed and random effect models.Our meta-analyses included 6,359 cases and 13,805 controls derived from 55 case-control studies, which included 12 genes (13 polymorphisms). Statistically significant associations with haemorrhagic stroke were identified for those homozygous for the ACE/I allele (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.20-1.83; p = 0.0003) and for the 5G allele in the SERPINE1 4G/5G polymorphism (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.03-1.96; p = 0.03). In addition, both epsilon2 and epsilon4 alleles of APOE were significantly associated with lobar haemorrhage (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.26-2.62; p = 0.002 and OR, 1.49; 95% 1.08-2.05; p = 0.01 respectively). Furthermore, a significant protective association against haemorrhagic stroke was found for the factor V Leiden mutation (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.10-0.87; p = 0.03).Our data suggests a genetic contribution to some types of haemorrhagic stroke, with no overall responsible single gene but rather supporting a polygenic aetiology . However, the evidence base is smaller compared to ischaemic stroke. Importantly, for several alleles previously found to be associated with protection from ischaemic stroke, there was a trend towards an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke.",
        "Understanding what constitutes high quality habitat is crucial for the conservation of species, especially those threatened with extinction. Habitat quality frequently is inferred by comparing the attributes of sites where a species is present with those where it is absent. However, species presence may not always indicate high quality habitat. Demographic parameters are likely to provide a more biologically relevant measure of quality, including a species' ability to successfully reproduce. We examined factors believed to influence territory quality for the grey-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis), a cooperatively breeding woodland bird that has experienced major range contraction and population decline in south-eastern Australia. Across three broad regions, we identified active territories and determined the presence of fledglings and the size of family groups, as surrogates of territory quality. These measures were modelled in relation to habitat attributes within territories, the extent of surrounding wooded vegetation, isolation from neighbouring groups, and the size of the neighbourhood population. Fledgling presence was strongly positively associated with group size, indicating that helpers enhance breeding success. Surprisingly, no other territory or landscape-scale variables predicted territory quality, as inferred from either breeding success or group size. Relationships between group size and environmental variables may be obscured by longer-term dynamics in group size. Variation in biotic interactions, notably competition from the noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala), also may contribute. Conservation actions that enhance the number and size of family groups will contribute towards reversing declines of this species. Despite associated challenges, demographic studies have potential to identify mechanistic processes that underpin population performance; critical knowledge for effective conservation management.",
        "Invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells are a T cell subset expressing an invariant T Cell Receptor (TCR) that recognizes glycolipid antigens rather than peptides. The cells have both innate-like rapid cytokine release, and adaptive-like thymic positive selection. iNKT cell activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma and inflammatory diseases, while reduced iNKT cell activation promotes infectious disease, cancer and certain autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Therapeutic means to reduce or deplete iNKT cells could treat inflammatory diseases, while approaches to promote their activation may have potential in certain infectious diseases, cancer or autoimmunity. Thus, we developed invariant TCR-specific monoclonal antibodies to better understand the role of iNKT cells in disease. We report here the first monoclonal antibodies specific for the mouse invariant TCR that by modifying the Fc construct can specifically deplete or activate iNKT cells in vivo in otherwise fully immuno-competent animals. We have used both the depleting and activating version of the antibody in the NOD model of T1D. As demonstrated previously using genetically iNKT cell deficient NOD mice, and in studies of glycolipid antigen activated iNKT cells in standard NOD mice, we found that antibody mediated depletion or activation of iNKT cells respectively accelerated and retarded T1D onset. In BALB/c mice, ovalbumin (OVA) mediated airway hyper-reactivity (AHR) was abrogated with iNKT cell depletion prior to OVA sensitization, confirming studies in knockout mice. Depletion of iNKT cells after sensitization had no effect on AHR in the conducting airways but did reduce AHR in the lung periphery. This result raises caution in the interpretation of studies that use animals that are genetically iNKT cell deficient from birth. These activating and depleting antibodies provide a novel tool to assess the therapeutic potential of iNKT cell manipulation.",
        "How farming systems supply sufficient nitrogen (N) for high yields but with reduced N losses is a central challenge for reducing the tradeoffs often associated with N cycling in agriculture. Variability in soil organic matter and management of organic farms across an agricultural landscape may yield insights for improving N cycling and for evaluating novel indicators of N availability. We assessed yields, plant-soil N cycling, and root expression of N metabolism genes across a representative set of organic fields growing Roma-type tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.) in an intensively-managed agricultural landscape in California, USA. The fields spanned a three-fold range of soil carbon (C) and N but had similar soil types, texture, and pH. Organic tomato yields ranged from 22.9 to 120.1 Mg ha-1 with a mean similar to the county average (86.1 Mg ha-1), which included mostly conventionally-grown tomatoes. Substantial variability in soil inorganic N concentrations, tomato N, and root gene expression indicated a range of possible tradeoffs between yields and potential for N losses across the fields. Fields showing evidence of tightly-coupled plant-soil N cycling, a desirable scenario in which high crop yields are supported by adequate N availability but low potential for N loss, had the highest total and labile soil C and N and received organic matter inputs with a range of N availability. In these fields, elevated expression of a key gene involved in root N assimilation, cytosolic glutamine synthetase GS1, confirmed that plant N assimilation was high even when inorganic N pools were low. Thus tightly-coupled N cycling occurred on several working organic farms. Novel combinations of N cycling indicators (i.e. inorganic N along with soil microbial activity and root gene expression for N assimilation) would support adaptive management for improved N cycling on organic as well as conventional farms, especially when plant-soil N cycling is rapid.",
        "We have previously identified homologs for nearly half of the approximately 30 known yeast Atg's in the genome database of the human sleeping sickness parasite Trypanosoma brucei. So far, only a few of these homologs have their role in autophagy experimentally confirmed. Among the candidates was the ortholog of Atg24 that is involved in pexophagy in yeast. In T. brucei, the peroxisome-like organelles named glycosomes harbor core metabolic processes, especially glycolysis. In the autotrophic yeast, autophagy is essential for adaptation to different nutritional environments by participating in the renewal of the peroxisome population. We hypothesized that autophagic turnover of the parasite's glycosomes plays a role in differentiation during its life cycle, which demands adaptation to different host environments and associated dramatic changes in nutritional conditions. We therefore characterized T. brucei ATG24, the T. brucei ortholog of yeast Atg24 and mammalian SNX4, and found it to have a regulatory role in autophagy and differentiation as well as endocytic trafficking. ATG24 partially localized on endocytic membranes where it was recruited via PI3-kinase III/VPS34. ATG24 silencing severely impaired receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin, but not adsorptive uptake of a lectin, and caused a major enlargement of the flagellar pocket. ATG24 silencing approximately doubled the number of autophagosomes, suggesting a role in repressing autophagy, and strongly accelerated differentiation, in accordance with a role of autophagy in parasite differentiation. Overexpression of the two isoforms of T. brucei ATG8 fused to GFP slowed down differentiation, possibly by a dominant-negative effect. This was overcome by ATG24 depletion, further supporting its regulatory role.",
        "Tiger (Panthera tigris), an endangered species, is under severe threat from poaching, habitat loss, prey depletion and habitat disturbance. Such factors have been reported causing local extermination of tiger populations including in one of the most important reserves in India, namely Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR) in northwestern India. Consequently, tigers were reintroduced in STR between 2008 and 2010, but inadequate breeding success was observed over the years, thus invoking an investigation to ascertain physiological correlates. In the present study, we report glucocorticoid stress responses of the reintroduced tigers in relation to anthropogenic disturbance in the STR from 2011 to 2013. We found anthropogenic disturbance such as encounter rates of livestock and humans, distance to roads and efforts to kill domestic livestock associated with an elevation in fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations in the monitored tigers. In this regard, female tigers seem more sensitive to such disturbance than males. It was possible to discern that tiger's fGCM levels were significantly positively related to the time spent in disturbed areas. Resulting management recommendations include relocation of villages from core areas and restriction of all anthropogenic activities in the entire STR.",
        "The accurate modeling of various features in high energy astrophysical scenarios requires the solution of the Einstein equations together with those of special relativistic hydrodynamics (SRHD). Such models are more complicated than the non-relativistic ones due to the nonlinear relations between the conserved and state variables. A high-resolution shock-capturing central upwind scheme is implemented to solve the given set of equations. The proposed technique uses the precise information of local propagation speeds to avoid the excessive numerical diffusion. The second order accuracy of the scheme is obtained with the use of MUSCL-type initial reconstruction and Runge-Kutta time stepping method. After a discussion of the equations solved and of the techniques employed, a series of one and two-dimensional test problems are carried out. To validate the method and assess its accuracy, the staggered central and the kinetic flux-vector splitting schemes are also applied to the same model. The scheme is robust and efficient. Its results are comparable to those obtained from the sophisticated algorithms, even in the case of highly relativistic two-dimensional test problems.",
        "Capturing human movement patterns across political borders is difficult and this difficulty highlights the need to investigate alternative data streams. With the advent of smart phones and the ability to attach accurate coordinates to Twitter messages, users leave a geographic digital footprint of their movement when posting tweets. In this study we analyzed 10 months of geo-located tweets for Kenya and were able to capture movement of people at different temporal (daily to periodic) and spatial (local, national to international) scales. We were also able to capture both long and short distances travelled, highlighting regional connections and cross-border movement between Kenya and the surrounding countries. The findings from this study has broad implications for studying movement patterns and mapping inter/intra-region movement dynamics.",
        "Matupás are floating vegetation islands found in floodplain lakes of the central Brazilian Amazon. They form initially from the agglomeration of aquatic vegetation, and through time can accumulate a substrate of organic matter sufficient to grow forest patches of several hectares in area and up to 12 m in height. There is little published information on matupás despite their singular characteristics and importance to local fauna and people. In this study we document the traditional ecological knowledge of riverine populations who live near and interact with matupás. We expected that their knowledge, acquired through long term observations and use in different stages of the matupá life cycle, could help clarify various aspects about the ecology and natural history of these islands that field biologists may not have had the opportunity to observe. Research was carried out in five riverine communities of the Amanã Sustainable Development Reserve (Brazil). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 45 inhabitants in order to register local understandings of how matupás are formed, biotic/abiotic factors related to their occurrence, the plants and animals that occur on them, their ecological relevance, and local uses. Local people elucidated several little-known aspects about matupá ecology, especially regarding the importance of seasonal dynamics of high/low water for matupás formation and the relevance of these islands for fish populations. Soil from matupás is especially fertile and is frequently gathered for use in vegetable gardens. In some cases, crops are planted directly onto matupás, representing an incipient agricultural experiment that was previously undocumented in the Amazon. Matupás are also considered a strategic habitat for fishing, mainly for arapaima (Arapaima gigas). The systematic study of traditional ecological knowledge proved to be an important tool for understanding this little-known Amazonian landscape.",
        "Cognitive control (CC) of attention is a major prerequisite for effective information processing. Emotional distractors can bias and impair goal-directed deployment of attentional resources. Frustration-induced negative affect and cognition can act as internal distractors with negative impact on task performance. Consolidation of CC may thus support task-oriented behavior under challenging conditions. Recently, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been put forward as an effective tool to modulate CC. Particularly, anodal, activity enhancing tDCS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) can increase insufficient CC in depression as indicated by a reduction of attentional biases induced by emotionally salient stimuli. With this study, we provide first evidence that, compared to sham stimulation, tDCS to the left dlPFC enhances processing speed measured by an adaptive version of the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT) that is typically thwarted by frustration. Notably, despite an even larger amount of error-related negative feedback, the task-induced upset was suppressed in the group receiving anodal tDCS. Moreover, inhibition of task-related negative affect was correlated with performance gains, suggesting a close link between enhanced processing speed and consolidation of CC by tDCS. Together, these data provide first evidence that activity enhancing anodal tDCS to the left dlPFC can support focused cognitive processing particularly when challenged by frustration-induced negative affect.",
        "Lipid A is a major hydrophobic component of lipopolysaccharides (endotoxin) present in the membrane of most Gram-negative bacteria, and the major responsible for the bioactivity and toxicity of the endotoxin. Previous studies have demonstrated that the late afterglow region of flowing post-discharges at reduced pressure (1-20 Torr) can be used for the sterilization of surfaces and of the reusable medical instrumentation. In the present paper, we show that the antibacterial activity of a pure nitrogen afterglow can essentially be attributed to the large concentrations of nitrogen atoms present in the treatment area and not to the UV radiation of the afterglow. In parallel, the time variation of the inactivation efficiency quantified by the log reduction of the initial Escherichia coli (E. coli) population is correlated with morphologic changes observed on the bacteria by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for increasing afterglow exposure times. The effect of the afterglow exposure is also studied on pure lipid A and on lipid A extracted from exposed E. coli bacteria. We report that more than 60% of lipid A (pure or bacteria-extracted) are lost with the used operating conditions (nitrogen flow QN2 = 1 standard liter per minute (slpm), pressure p = 5 Torr, microwave injected power PMW = 200 W, exposure time: 40 minutes). The afterglow exposure also results in a reduction of the lipid A proinflammatory activity, assessed by the net decrease of the redox-sensitive NFκB transcription factor nuclear translocation in murine aortic endothelial cells stimulated with control vs afterglow-treated (pure and extracted) lipid A. Altogether these results point out the ability of reduced pressure nitrogen afterglows to neutralize the cytotoxic components in Gram-negative bacteria.",
        "The words 'infection' and 'inflammation' lack specific definitions. Here, such words are not defined. Instead, the ability to visualize host-microbial interactions was explored.Leukocyte differential counts and four bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Staphylococcus chromogenes, and Escherichia coli) were determined or isolated in a cross-sectional and randomized study conducted with 611 bovine milk samples. Two paradigms were evaluated: (i) the classic one, which measures non-structured (count or percent) data; and (ii) a method that, using complex data structures, detects and differentiates three-dimensional (3D) interactions among lymphocytes (L), macrophages (M), and neutrophils (N).Classic analyses failed to differentiate bacterial-positive (B+) from -negative (B-) observations: B- and B+ data overlapped, even when statistical significance was achieved. In contrast, the alternative approach showed distinct patterns, such as perpendicular data inflections, which discriminated microbial-negative/mononuclear cell-predominating (MCP) from microbial-positive/phagocyte-predominating (PP) subsets. Two PP subcategories were distinguished, as well as PP/culture-negative (false-negative) and MCP/culture-positive (false-positive) observations. In 3D space, MCP and PP subsets were perpendicular to one another, displaying ≥ 91% specificity or sensitivity. Findings supported five inferences: (i) disease is not always ruled out by negative bacterial tests; (ii) low total cell counts can coexist with high phagocyte percents; (iii) neither positive bacterial isolation nor high cell counts always coincide with PP profiles; (iv) statistical significance is not synonymous with discrimination; and (v) hidden relationships cannot be detected when simple (non-structured) data formats are used and statistical analyses are performed before data subsets are identified, but can be uncovered when complexity is investigated.Pattern recognition-based assessments can detect host-microbial interactions usually unobserved. Such cutoff-free, confidence interval-free, gold standard-free approaches provide interpretable information on complex entities, such as 'infection' and 'inflammation', even without definitions. To investigate disease dynamics, combinations of observational and experimental longitudinal studies, on human and non-human infections, are recommended.",
        "Several meta-analyses confirmed the five most prevalent human papillomavirus (HPV) strains in women with and without cervical neoplastic diseases are HPV16, 18, 31, 52, and 58. HPV16/18 are the predominant oncogenic genotypes, causing approximately 70% of global cervical cancer cases. The vast majority of the women studied in previous analyses were from Europe, North America, Asia, and most recently Latin America and the Caribbean. Despite the high burden of cervical cancer morbidity and mortality in Africa, a robust meta-analysis of HPV genotype prevalence and distribution in African women is lacking.We systematically searched 14 major databases from inception to August 2013 without language restriction, following the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Seventy-one studies from 23 African countries were identified after screening 1162 citations and data abstracted and study quality appraised from 195 articles. HPV type-specific prevalence and distribution was estimated from 17,273 cases of women with normal cervical cytology; 1019 women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS); 1444 women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL); 1571 women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL); and 4,067 cases of invasive cervical carcinoma (ICC). Overall prevalence of HPV16/18 were 4.4% and 2.8% of women with normal cytology, 12.0% and 4.4% with ASCUS, 14.5% and 10.0% with LSIL, 31.2% and 13.9% with HSIL, and 49.7% and 18.0% with ICC, respectively. Study limitations include the lack of adequate data from Middle and Northern African regions, and variations in the HPV type-specific sensitivity of different genotyping protocols.To our knowledge, this study is the most comprehensive assessment of the overall prevalence and distribution of HPV genotypes in African women with and without different cervical neoplasias. We have established that HPV16/18 account for 67.7% of ICC cases among African women. Based on our findings, we highly recommend the administration of existing prophylactic vaccines to younger women not infected with HPV16/18 and an increase in HPV screening efforts for high-risk genotypes to prevent cervical cancer.International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews CRD42013006558.",
        "The marine epiphytic dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus is a toxicologically important genus responsible for ciguatera fish poisoning, the principal cause of non-bacterial illness associated with fish consumption. The genus currently contains species exhibiting either globular or anterior-posteriorly compressed morphologies with marked differences in cell shape and plate arrangement. Here we report a third globular, epiphytic and tychoplanktonic species from the coasts of Ubatuba, Brazil. The new species can be distinguished from G. yasumotoi and G. ruetzleri by its broader first apical plate that occupies a larger portion of the epitheca. Accordingly, phylogenetic trees from small subunit (SSU) and large subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA sequences also showed strongly supported separation of the new species from the G. yasumotoi/G. ruetzleri group albeit with short distance. The molecular phylogenies, which included new sequences of the planktonic species Goniodoma polyedricum, further indicated that the globular species of Gambierdiscus formed a tight clade, clearly separated (with strong bootstrap support) from the clade of lenticular species including the type for Gambierdiscus. The morphological and molecular data in concert support the split of Gambierdiscus sensu lato into two genera. Gambierdiscus sensu stricto should be reserved for the species with lenticular shapes, highly compressed anterioposteriorly, with short-shank fishhook apical pore plate, large 2' plate, low and ascending cingular displacement, and pouch-like sulcal morphology. The new genus name Fukuyoa gen. nov. should be applied to the globular species, slightly laterally compressed, with long-shank fishhook apical pore plate, large 1' plate, greater and descending cingular displacement, and not pouch-like vertically-oriented sulcal morphology. Fukuyoa contains the new species Fukuyoa paulensis gen. et sp. nov., and F. yasumotoi comb. nov. and F. ruetzleri comb. nov.",
        "The surgical repair of heart and vascular disease often requires implanting synthetic grafts. While synthetic grafts have been successfully used for medium-to-large sized arteries, applications for small diameter arteries (<6 mm) is limited due to high rates of occlusion by thrombosis. Our objective was to develop a tissue engineered vascular graft (TEVG) for small diameter arteries. TEVGs composed of polylactic acid nanofibers with inner luminal diameter between 0.5 and 0.6 mm were surgically implanted as infra-renal aortic interposition conduits in 25 female C17SCID/bg mice. Twelve mice were given sham operations. Survival of mice with TEVG grafts was 91.6% at 12 months post-implantation (sham group: 83.3%). No instances of graft stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation were observed over 12 months post-implantation, assessed by Doppler ultrasound and microCT. Histologic analysis of explanted TEVG grafts showed presence of CD31-positive endothelial monolayer and F4/80-positive macrophages after 4, 8, and 12 months in vivo. Cells positive for α-smooth muscle actin were observed within TEVG, demonstrating presence of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Neo-extracellular matrix consisting mostly of collagen types I and III were observed at 12 months post-implantation. PCR analysis supports histological observations. TEVG group showed significant increases in expressions of SMC marker, collagen-I and III, matrix metalloproteinases-2 and 9, and itgam (a macrophage marker), when compared to sham group. Overall, patency rates were excellent at 12 months after implantation, as structural integrity of these TEVG. Tissue analysis also demonstrated vessel remodeling by autologous cell.",
        "Executive functions (EFs) training interventions aimed at ADHD-symptom reduction have yielded mixed results. Generally, these interventions focus on training a single cognitive domain (e.g., working memory [WM], inhibition, or cognitive-flexibility). However, evidence suggests that most children with ADHD show deficits on multiple EFs, and that these EFs are largely related to different brain regions. Therefore, training multiple EFs might be a potentially more effective strategy to reduce EF-related ADHD symptoms.Eighty-nine children with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD (aged 8-12) were randomized to either a full-active-condition where visuospatial WM, inhibition and cognitive-flexibility were trained, a partially-active-condition where inhibition and cognitive-flexibility were trained and the WM-training task was presented in placebo-mode, or to a full placebo-condition. Short-term and long-term (3-months) effects of this gamified, 25-session, home-based computer-training were evaluated on multiple outcome domains.During training compliance was high (only 3% failed to meet compliance criteria). After training, only children in the full-active condition showed improvement on measures of visuospatial short-term-memory (STM) and WM. Inhibitory performance and interference control only improved in the full-active- and the partially-active condition. No Treatment-condition x Time interactions were found for cognitive-flexibility, verbal WM, complex-reasoning, nor for any parent-, teacher-, or child-rated ADHD behaviors, EF-behaviors, motivational behaviors, or general problem behaviors. Nonetheless, almost all measures showed main Time-effects, including the teacher-ratings.Improvements on inhibition and visuospatial STM and WM were specifically related to the type of treatment received. However, transfer to untrained EFs and behaviors was mostly nonspecific (i.e., only interference control improved exclusively in the two EF training conditions). As such, in this multiple EF-training, mainly nonspecific treatment factors - as opposed to the specific effects of training EFs-seem related to far transfer effects found on EF and behavior.trialregister.nl NTR2728.

        "Serum N-glycans have been identified as putative biomarkers for numerous diseases. The impact of different serum sample tubes and processing methods on N-glycan analysis has received relatively little attention. This study aimed to determine the effect of different sample tubes and processing methods on the whole serum N-glycan profile in both health and disease. A secondary objective was to describe a robot automated N-glycan release, labeling and cleanup process for use in a biomarker discovery system.25 patients with active and quiescent inflammatory bowel disease and controls had three different serum sample tubes taken at the same draw. Two different processing methods were used for three types of tube (with and without gel-separation medium). Samples were randomised and processed in a blinded fashion. Whole serum N-glycan release, 2-aminobenzamide labeling and cleanup was automated using a Hamilton Microlab STARlet Liquid Handling robot. Samples were analysed using a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography/ethylene bridged hybrid(BEH) column on an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography instrument. Data were analysed quantitatively by pairwise correlation and hierarchical clustering using the area under each chromatogram peak. Qualitatively, a blinded assessor attempted to match chromatograms to each individual.There was small intra-individual variation in serum N-glycan profiles from samples collected using different sample processing methods. Intra-individual correlation coefficients were between 0.99 and 1. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering and principal coordinate analyses accurately matched samples from the same individual. Qualitative analysis demonstrated good chromatogram overlay and a blinded assessor was able to accurately match individuals based on chromatogram profile, regardless of disease status.The three different serum sample tubes processed using the described methods cause minimal inter-individual variation in serum whole N-glycan profile when processed using an automated workstream. This has important implications for N-glycan biomarker discovery studies using different serum processing standard operating procedures.",
        "Plasmodium knowlesi is a newly described zoonosis that causes malaria in the human population that can be severe and fatal. The study of P. knowlesi parasites from human clinical isolates is relatively new and, in order to obtain maximum information from patient sample collections, we explored the possibility of generating P. knowlesi genome sequences from archived clinical isolates. Our patient sample collection consisted of frozen whole blood samples that contained excessive human DNA contamination and, in that form, were not suitable for parasite genome sequencing. We developed a method to reduce the amount of human DNA in the thawed blood samples in preparation for high throughput parasite genome sequencing using Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq sequencing platforms. Seven of fifteen samples processed had sufficiently pure P. knowlesi DNA for whole genome sequencing. The reads were mapped to the P. knowlesi H strain reference genome and an average mapping of 90% was obtained. Genes with low coverage were removed leaving 4623 genes for subsequent analyses. Previously we identified a DNA sequence dimorphism on a small fragment of the P. knowlesi normocyte binding protein xa gene on chromosome 14. We used the genome data to assemble full-length Pknbpxa sequences and discovered that the dimorphism extended along the gene. An in-house algorithm was developed to detect SNP sites co-associating with the dimorphism. More than half of the P. knowlesi genome was dimorphic, involving genes on all chromosomes and suggesting that two distinct types of P. knowlesi infect the human population in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. We use P. knowlesi clinical samples to demonstrate that Plasmodium DNA from archived patient samples can produce high quality genome data. We show that analyses, of even small numbers of difficult clinical malaria isolates, can generate comprehensive genomic information that will improve our understanding of malaria parasite diversity and pathobiology.",
        "Scavenger receptor associated with endothelial cells I (SREC-I) was shown to be expressed in immune cells and to play a role in the endocytosis of peptides and antigen presentation. As our previous studies indicated that SREC-I required intact Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression for its functions in tumor immunity, we examined potential interactions between these two receptors. We have shown here that SREC-I became associated with TLR4 on binding bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in RAW 264.7 and HEK 293 cells overexpressing these two receptors. The receptors then became internalized together in intracellular endosomes. SREC-I promoted TLR4-induced signal transduction through the NF-kB and MAP kinase pathways, leading to enhanced inflammatory cytokine release. Activation of inflammatory signaling through SREC-I/TLR4 complexes appeared to involve recruitment of the receptors into detergent-insoluble, cholesterol-rich lipid microdomains that contained the small GTPase Cdc42 and the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-src. Under conditions of SREC-I activation by LPS, TLR4 activity required Cdc42 as well as cholesterol and actin polymerization for signaling through NF-kB and MAP kinase pathways in RAW 264.7 cells. SREC-I appeared to respond differently to another ligand, the molecular chaperone Hsp90 that, while triggering SREC-I-TLR4 binding caused only faint activation of the NF-kB pathway. Our experiments therefore indicated that SREC-I could bind LPS and might be involved in innate inflammatory immune responses to extracellular danger signals in RAW 264.7 cells or bone marrow-derived macrophages.",
        "The biology of modern Conidae (cone snails)--which includes the hyperdiverse genus Conus--has been intensively studied, but the fossil record of the clade remains poorly understood, particularly within an evolutionary framework. Here, ultraviolet light is used to reveal and characterize the original shell coloration patterns of 28 species of cone snails from three Neogene coral reef-associated deposits from the Cibao Valley, northern Dominican Republic. These fossils come from the upper Miocene Cercado Fm. and lower Pliocene Gurabo Fm., and range in age from about 6.6-4.8 Ma. Comparison of the revealed coloration patterns with those of extant species allow the taxa to be assigned to three genera of cone snails (Profundiconus, Conasprella, and Conus) and at least nine subgenera. Thirteen members of these phylogenetically diverse reef faunas are described as new species. These include: Profundiconus? hennigi, Conasprella (Ximeniconus) ageri, Conus anningae, Conus lyelli, Conus (Atlanticonus?) franklinae, Conus (Stephanoconus) gouldi, Conus (Stephanoconus) bellacoensis, Conus (Ductoconus) cashi, Conus (Dauciconus) garrisoni, Conus (Dauciconus?) zambaensis, Conus (Spuriconus?) kaesleri, Conus (Spuriconus?) lombardii, and Conus (Lautoconus?) carlottae. Each of the three reef deposits contain a minimum of 14-16 cone snail species, levels of diversity that are similar to modern Indo-Pacific reef systems. Finally, most of the 28 species can be assigned to modern clades and thus have important implications for understanding the biogeographic and temporal histories of these clades in tropical America.",
        "To analyse the diagnostic signs present in slices of human breast tumour specimens using synchrotron radiation phase-contrast imaging computed tomography (PCI-CT) for the first time and assess the feasibility of this technique for clinical applications.The ethics committee of our university and relevant clinical hospital approved this prospective study, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. PCI-CT of human breast tumour specimens with synchrotron radiation was performed at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). A total of 14 specimens of early-stage carcinomas and 8 specimens of adenomas were enrolled. Based on raw data reconstruction, the diagnostic signs present in the slices were analysed and correlated with histopathology. We proposed a criterion for clinical diagnosis according to the evaluated signs and the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) for reference. The criterion was then assessed by clinicians in a double-blind method. Finally, descriptive statistics were evaluated, depending on the assessment results.The 14 carcinoma specimens and 8 adenoma specimens were diagnosed as malignant and benign tumours, respectively. The total coincidence rate was 100%.Our study results demonstrate that the X-ray diagnostic signs observed in the specimen slices and the criterion used for clinical diagnosis were accurate and reliable. The criterion based on signs analysis can be used to differentiate early-stage benign or malignant tumours. As a promising imaging method, PCI-CT can serve as a possible and feasible supplement to BI-RADS in the future.",
        "The methods currently available to deliver functional labels and drugs to the cell cytosol are inefficient and this constitutes a major obstacle to cell biology (delivery of sensors and imaging probes) and therapy (drug access to the cell internal machinery). As cell membranes are impermeable to most molecular cargos, viral peptides have been used to bolster their internalisation through endocytosis and help their release to the cytosol by bursting the endosomal vesicles. However, conflicting results have been reported on the extent of the cytosolic delivery achieved. To evaluate their potential, we used gold nanoparticles as model cargos and systematically assessed how the functionalisation of their surface by either or both of the viral peptides TAT and HA2 influenced their intracellular delivery. We evaluated the number of gold nanoparticles present in cells after internalisation using photothermal microscopy and their subcellular localisation by electron microscopy. While their uptake increased when the TAT and/or HA2 viral peptides were present on their surface, we did not observe a significant cytosolic delivery of the gold nanoparticles.",
        "DNA methylation is reprogrammed during early embryogenesis by active and passive mechanisms in advance of the first differentiation event producing the embryonic and extraembryonic lineage cells which contribute to the future embryo proper and to the placenta respectively. Embryonic lineage cells re-acquire a highly methylated genome dependent on the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b that are required for de novo methylation. By contrast, extraembryonic lineage cells remain globally hypomethylated but the mechanisms that underlie this hypomethylation remain unknown.We have employed an inducible system that supports differentiation between these two lineages and recapitulates the DNA methylation asymmetry generated in vivo. We find that in vitro down-regulation of Oct3/4 in ES cells recapitulates the decline in global DNA methylation associated with trophoblast. The de novo DNMTs Dnmt3a2 and Dnmt3b are down-regulated during trophoblast differentiation. Dnmt1, which is responsible for maintenance methylation, is expressed comparably in embryonic and trophoblast lineages, however importantly in trophoblast giant cells Dnmt1fails to be attracted to replication foci, thus allowing loss of DNA methylation while implicating a passive demethylation mechanism. Interestingly, Dnmt1 localization was restored by exogenous Np95/Uhrf1, a Dnmt1 chaperone required for Dnmt1-targeting to replication foci, yet DNA methylation levels remained low. Over-expression of de novo DNMTs also failed to increase DNA methylation in target sequences.We propose that induced trophoblast cells may have a mechanism to resist genome-wide increases of DNA methylation, thus reinforcing the genome-wide epigenetic distinctions between the embryonic and extraembryonic lineages in the mouse. This resistance may be based on transcription factors or on global differences in chromatin structure.",
        "Infection in pregnancy may be involved in the aetiology of pre-eclampsia. However, a clear association between acute maternal infection and pre-eclampsia has not been established. We assessed whether acute urinary tract infection, respiratory tract infection, and antibiotic drug prescriptions in pregnancy (a likely proxy for maternal infection) are associated with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia.We used a matched nested case-control design and data from the UK General Practice Research Database to examine the association between maternal infection and pre-eclampsia. Primiparous women aged at least 13 years and registered with a participating practice between January 1987 and October 2007 were eligible for inclusion. We selected all cases of pre-eclampsia and a random sample of primiparous women without pre-eclampsia (controls). Cases (n=1533) were individually matched with up to ten controls (n=14236) on practice and year of delivery. We calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for pre-eclampsia comparing women exposed and unexposed to infection using multivariable conditional logistic regression. After adjusting for maternal age, pre-gestational hypertension, diabetes, renal disease and multifetal gestation, the odds of pre-eclampsia were increased in women prescribed antibiotic drugs (adjusted odds ratio 1.28;1.14-1.44) and in women with urinary tract infection (adjusted odds ratio 1.22;1.03-1.45). We found no association with maternal respiratory tract infection (adjusted odds ratio 0.91;0.72-1.16). Further adjustment for maternal smoking and pre-pregnancy body mass index made no difference to our findings.Women who acquire a urinary infection during pregnancy, but not those who have a respiratory infection, are at an increased risk of pre-eclampsia. Maternal antibiotic prescriptions are also associated with an increased risk. Further research is required to elucidate the underlying mechanism of this association and to determine whether, among women who acquire infections in pregnancy, prompt treatment or prophylaxis against infection might reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia.",
        "α-Synuclein is a small protein strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders. We report here the use of in-cell NMR spectroscopy to observe directly the structure and dynamics of this protein within E. coli cells. To improve the accuracy in the measurement of backbone chemical shifts within crowded in-cell NMR spectra, we have developed a deconvolution method to reduce inhomogeneous line broadening within cellular samples. The resulting chemical shift values were then used to evaluate the distribution of secondary structure populations which, in the absence of stable tertiary contacts, are a most effective way to describe the conformational fluctuations of disordered proteins. The results indicate that, at least within the bacterial cytosol, α-synuclein populates a highly dynamic state that, despite the highly crowded environment, has the same characteristics as the disordered monomeric form observed in aqueous solution.",
        "Advancements in knowledge of obesity aetiology and mobile phone technology have created the opportunity to develop an electronic tool to predict an infant's risk of childhood obesity. The study aims were to develop and validate equations for the prediction of childhood obesity and integrate them into a mobile phone application (App).Anthropometry and childhood obesity risk data were obtained for 1868 UK-born White or South Asian infants in the Born in Bradford cohort. Logistic regression was used to develop prediction equations (at 6 ± 1.5, 9 ± 1.5 and 12 ± 1.5 months) for risk of childhood obesity (BMI at 2 years >91(st) centile and weight gain from 0-2 years >1 centile band) incorporating sex, birth weight, and weight gain as predictors. The discrimination accuracy of the equations was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC); internal validity by comparing area under the curve to those obtained in bootstrapped samples; and external validity by applying the equations to an external sample. An App was built to incorporate six final equations (two at each age, one of which included maternal BMI). The equations had good discrimination (AUCs 86-91%), with the addition of maternal BMI marginally improving prediction. The AUCs in the bootstrapped and external validation samples were similar to those obtained in the development sample. The App is user-friendly, requires a minimum amount of information, and provides a risk assessment of low, medium, or high accompanied by advice and website links to government recommendations.Prediction equations for risk of childhood obesity have been developed and incorporated into a novel App, thereby providing proof of concept that childhood obesity prediction research can be integrated with advancements in technology.",
        "Multivariate analysis is a very general and powerful technique for analysing Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. An outstanding problem however is how to make inferences that are consistent over a group of subjects as to whether there are condition-specific differences in data features, and what are those features that maximise these differences. Here we propose a solution based on Canonical Variates Analysis (CVA) model scoring at the subject level and random effects Bayesian model selection at the group level. We apply this approach to beamformer reconstructed MEG data in source space. CVA estimates those multivariate patterns of activation that correlate most highly with the experimental design; the order of a CVA model is then determined by the number of significant canonical vectors. Random effects Bayesian model comparison then provides machinery for inferring the optimal order over the group of subjects. Absence of a multivariate dependence is indicated by the null model being the most likely. This approach can also be applied to CVA models with a fixed number of canonical vectors but supplied with different feature sets. We illustrate the method by identifying feature sets based on variable-dimension MEG power spectra in the primary visual cortex and fusiform gyrus that are maximally discriminative of data epochs before versus after visual stimulation.",
        "Advances in next-generation sequencing technology have enabled systematic exploration of the contribution of rare variation to Mendelian and complex diseases. Although it is well known that population stratification can generate spurious associations with common alleles, its impact on rare variant association methods remains poorly understood. Here, we performed exhaustive coalescent simulations with demographic parameters calibrated from exome sequence data to evaluate the performance of nine rare variant association methods in the presence of fine-scale population structure. We find that all methods have an inflated spurious association rate for parameter values that are consistent with levels of differentiation typical of European populations. For example, at a nominal significance level of 5%, some test statistics have a spurious association rate as high as 40%. Finally, we empirically assess the impact of population stratification in a large data set of 4,298 European American exomes. Our results have important implications for the design, analysis, and interpretation of rare variant genome-wide association studies.",
        "In humans, dopamine is implicated in reward and risk-based decision-making. However, the specific effects of dopamine augmentation on risk evaluation are unclear. Here we sought to measure the effect of 100 mg oral levodopa, which enhances synaptic release of dopamine, on choice behaviour in healthy humans. We use a paradigm without feedback or learning, which solely isolates effects on risk evaluation. We present two studies (n = 20; n = 20) employing a randomised, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design. We manipulated different dimensions of risk in a controlled economic paradigm. We test effects on risk-reward tradeoffs, assaying both aversion to variance (the spread of possible outcomes) and preference for relative losses and gains (asymmetry of outcomes--skewness), dissociating this from potential non-specific effects on choice randomness using behavioural modelling. There were no systematic effects of levodopa on risk attitudes, either for variance or skewness. However, there was a drift towards more risk-averse behaviour over time, indicating that this paradigm was sensitive to detect changes in risk-preferences. These findings suggest that levodopa administration does not change the evaluation of risk. One possible reason is that dopaminergic influences on decision making may be due to changing the response to reward feedback.",
        "Mortality from bacterial meningitis in African adults is significantly higher than those in better resourced settings and adjunctive therapeutic interventions such as dexamethasone and glycerol have been shown to be ineffective. We conducted a study analysing data from clinical trials of bacterial meningitis in Blantyre, Malawi to investigate the clinical parameters associated with this high mortality.We searched for all clinical trials undertaken in Blantyre investigating bacterial meningitis from 1990 to the current time and combined the data from all included trial datasets into one database. We used logistic regression to relate individual clinical parameters to mortality. Adults with community acquired bacterial meningitis were included if the CSF culture isolate was consistent with meningitis or if the CSF white cell count was >100 cells/mm(3) (>50% neutrophils) in HIV negative participants and >5 cells/mm(3) in HIV positive participants. Outcome was measured by mortality at discharge from hospital (after 10 days of antibiotic therapy) and community follow up (day 40).Seven hundred and fifteen episodes of bacterial meningitis were evaluated. The mortality rate was 45% at day 10 and 54% at day 40. The most common pathogens were S.pneumoniae (84% of positive CSF isolates) and N.meningitidis (4%). 607/694 (87%) participants tested were HIV antibody positive. Treatment delays within the hospital system were marked. The median presenting GCS was 12/15, 17% had GCS<8 and 44.9% had a seizure during the illness. Coma, seizures, tachycardia and anaemia were all significantly associated with mortality on multivariate analysis. HIV status and pneumococcal culture positivity in the CSF were not associated with mortality. Adults with community acquired bacterial meningitis in Malawi present with a severe clinical phenotype. Predictors of high mortality are different to those seen in Western settings. Optimising in-hospital care and minimising treatment delays presents an opportunity to improve outcomes considerably.",
        "Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) measured with Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) is a powerful technique to investigate spatio-temporal regulation of protein-protein interactions in living cells. When using standard fitting methods to analyze time domain FLIM, the correct estimation of the FRET parameters requires a high number of photons and therefore long acquisition times which are incompatible with the observation of dynamic protein-protein interactions. Recently, non-fitting strategies have been developed for the analysis of FLIM images: the polar plot or \"phasor\" and the minimal fraction of interacting donor mfD . We propose here a novel non-fitting strategy based on the calculation of moments. We then compare the performance of these three methods when shortening the acquisition time: either by reducing the number of counted photons N or the number of temporal channels Nch , which is particularly adapted for the original fast-FLIM prototype presented in this work that employs the time gated approach. Based on theoretical calculations, Monte Carlo simulations and experimental data, we determine the domain of validity of each method. We thus demonstrate that the polar approach remains accurate for a large range of conditions (low N, Nch or small fractions of interacting donor fD ). The validity domain of the moments method is more restricted (not applicable when fD <0.25 or when Nch  = 4) but it is more precise than the polar approach. We also demonstrate that the mfD is robust in all conditions and it is the most precise strategy; although it does not strictly provide the fraction of interacting donor. We show using the fast-FLIM prototype (with an acquisition rate up to 1 Hz) that these non-fitting strategies are very powerful for on-line analysis on a standard computer and thus for quantifying automatically the spatio-temporal activation of Rac-GTPase in living cells by FRET.",
        "Mutations within the NOTCH3 gene cause cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). CADASIL mutations appear to be restricted to the first twenty-four exons, resulting in the gain or loss of a cysteine amino acid. The role of other exonic NOTCH3 variation not involving cysteine residues and mutations in exons 25-33 in ischemic stroke remains unresolved.All 33 exons of NOTCH3 were sequenced in 269 Caucasian probands from the Siblings With Ischemic Stroke Study (SWISS), a 70-center North American affected sibling pair study and 95 healthy Caucasian control subjects. Variants identified by sequencing in the SWISS probands were then tested for association with ischemic stroke using US Caucasian controls collected at the Mayo Clinic (n=654), and further assessed in a Caucasian (n=802) and African American (n=298) patient-control series collected through the Ischemic Stroke Genetics Study (ISGS).Sequencing of the 269 SWISS probands identified one (0.4%) with small vessel type stroke carrying a known CADASIL mutation (p.R558C; Exon 11). Of the 19 common NOTCH3 variants identified, the only variant significantly associated with ischemic stroke after multiple testing adjustment was p.R1560P (rs78501403; Exon 25) in the combined SWISS and ISGS Caucasian series (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.50, P=0.0022) where presence of the minor allele was protective against ischemic stroke. Although only significant prior to adjustment for multiple testing, p.T101T (rs3815188; Exon 3) was associated with an increased risk of small-vessel stroke (OR: 1.56, P=0.008) and p.P380P (rs61749020; Exon 7) was associated with decreased risk of large-vessel stroke (OR: 0.35, P=0.047) in Caucasians. No significant associations were observed in the small African American series.Cysteine-affecting NOTCH3 mutations are rare in patients with typical ischemic stroke, however our observation that common NOTCH3 variants may be associated with risk of ischemic stroke warrants further study.",
        "An up-to-date and reliable map of podoconiosis is needed to design geographically targeted and cost-effective intervention in Ethiopia. Identifying the ecological correlates of the distribution of podoconiosis is the first step for distribution and risk maps. The objective of this study was to investigate the spatial distribution and ecological correlates of podoconiosis using historical and contemporary survey data.Data on the observed prevalence of podoconiosis were abstracted from published and unpublished literature into a standardized database, according to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. In total, 10 studies conducted between 1969 and 2012 were included, and data were available for 401,674 individuals older than 15 years of age from 229 locations. A range of high resolution environmental factors were investigated to determine their association with podoconiosis prevalence, using logistic regression.The prevalence of podoconiosis in Ethiopia was estimated at 3.4% (95% CI 3.3%-3.4%) with marked regional variation. We identified significant associations between mean annual Land Surface Temperature (LST), mean annual precipitation, topography of the land and fine soil texture and high prevalence of podoconiosis. The derived maps indicate both widespread occurrence of podoconiosis and a marked variability in prevalence of podoconiosis, with prevalence typically highest at altitudes >1500 m above sea level (masl), with >1500 mm annual rainfall and mean annual LST of 19-21°C. No (or very little) podoconiosis occurred at altitudes <1225 masl, with annual rainfall <900 mm, and mean annual LST of >24°C.Podoconiosis remains a public health problem in Ethiopia over considerable areas of the country, but exhibits marked geographical variation associated in part with key environmental factors. This is work in progress and the results presented here will be refined in future work.",
        "Accurate associative learning is often hindered by confirmation bias and success-chasing, which together can conspire to produce or solidify false beliefs in the decision-maker. We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging in 35 experienced physicians, while they learned to choose between two treatments in a series of virtual patient encounters. We estimated a learning model for each subject based on their observed behavior and this model divided clearly into high performers and low performers. The high performers showed small, but equal learning rates for both successes (positive outcomes) and failures (no response to the drug). In contrast, low performers showed very large and asymmetric learning rates, learning significantly more from successes than failures; a tendency that led to sub-optimal treatment choices. Consistently with these behavioral findings, high performers showed larger, more sustained BOLD responses to failed vs. successful outcomes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule while low performers displayed the opposite response profile. Furthermore, participants' learning asymmetry correlated with anticipatory activation in the nucleus accumbens at trial onset, well before outcome presentation. Subjects with anticipatory activation in the nucleus accumbens showed more success-chasing during learning. These results suggest that high performers' brains achieve better outcomes by attending to informative failures during training, rather than chasing the reward value of successes. The differential brain activations between high and low performers could potentially be developed into biomarkers to identify efficient learners on novel decision tasks, in medical or other contexts.",
        "Treatment seeking delays among people living with HIV have adverse consequences for outcome. Gender differences in treatment outcomes have been observed in sub-Saharan Africa.To better understand antiretroviral treatment (ART) seeking behaviour in HIV-infected adults in rural Malawi.Qualitative interviews with male and female participants in an ART cohort study at a treatment site in rural northern Malawi triangulated with analysis of baseline clinical and demographic data for 365 individuals attending sequentially for ART screening between January 2008 and September 2009.43% of the cohort presented with late stage HIV disease classified as WHO stage 3/4. Respondents reported that women's frequency of testing, health awareness and commitment to children led to earlier ART uptake and that men's commitment to wider social networks of influence, masculine ideals of strength, and success with sexual and marital partners led them to refuse treatment until they were sick. Quantitative analysis of the screening cohort provided supporting evidence for these expressed views. Overall, male gender (adjusted OR 2.3, 95% CI1.3-3.9) and never being married (adjusted OR 4.1, 95% CI1.5-11.5) were risk factors for late presentation, whereas having ≥3 dependent children was associated with earlier presentation (adjusted OR 0.31, 95% CI0.15-0.63), compared to those with no dependent children.Gender-specific barriers and facilitators operate throughout the whole process of seeking care. Further efforts to enrol men into care earlier should focus on the masculine characteristics that they value, and the risks to these of severe health decline. Our results emphasise the value of exploring as well as identifying behavioural correlates of late presentation.",
        "Early start of enteral feeding is an established treatment strategy in intubated patients in intensive care since it reduces invasive bacterial infections and length of hospital stay. There is equipoise whether early enteral feeding is also beneficial in non-intubated patients with cerebral malaria in resource poor settings. We hypothesized that the risk of aspiration pneumonia might outweigh the potential benefits of earlier recovery and prevention of hypoglycaemia.A randomized trial of early (day of admission) versus late (after 60 hours in adults or 36 hours in children) start of enteral feeding was undertaken in patients with cerebral malaria in Chittagong, Bangladesh from May 2008 to August 2009. The primary outcome measures were incidence of aspiration pneumonia, hypoglycaemia and coma recovery time. The trial was terminated after inclusion of 56 patients because of a high incidence of aspiration pneumonia in the early feeding group (9/27 (33%)), compared to the late feeding group (0/29 (0%)), p = 0.001). One patient in the late feeding group, and none in the early group, had hypoglycaemia during admission. There was no significant difference in overall mortality (9/27 (33%) vs 6/29 (21%), p = 0.370), but mortality was 5/9 (56%) in patients with aspiration pneumonia.In conclusion, early start of enteral feeding is detrimental in non-intubated patients with cerebral malaria in many resource-poor settings. Evidence gathered in resource rich settings is not necessarily transferable to resource-poor settings.Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN57488577.",
        "In severe asthma, bronchodilator- and steroid-insensitive airflow obstruction develops through unknown mechanisms characterized by increased lung airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass and stiffness. We explored the role of a Regulator of G-protein Signaling protein (RGS4) in the ASM hyperplasia and reduced contractile capacity characteristic of advanced asthma. Using immunocytochemical staining, ASM expression of RGS4 was determined in endobronchial biopsies from healthy subjects and those from subjects with mild, moderate and severe asthma. Cell proliferation assays, agonist-induced calcium mobilization and bronchoconstriction were determined in cultured human ASM cells and in human precision cut lung slices. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches, the precise role of RGS proteins was determined in stimulating human ASM proliferation and inhibiting bronchoconstriction. RGS4 expression was restricted to a subpopulation of ASM and was specifically upregulated by mitogens, which induced a hyperproliferative and hypocontractile ASM phenotype similar to that observed in recalcitrant asthma. RGS4 expression was markedly increased in bronchial smooth muscle of patients with severe asthma, and expression correlated significantly with reduced pulmonary function. Whereas RGS4 inhibited G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated bronchoconstriction, unexpectedly RGS4 was required for PDGF-induced proliferation and sustained activation of PI3K, a mitogenic signaling molecule that regulates ASM proliferation. These studies indicate that increased RGS4 expression promotes a phenotypic switch of ASM, evoking irreversible airway obstruction in subjects with severe asthma.",
        "Diagnostic information for psychiatric research often depends on both clinical interviews and medical records. Although discrepancies between these two sources are well known, there have been few studies into the degree and origins of inconsistencies.We compared data from structured interviews and medical records on 1,970 Han Chinese women with recurrent DSM-IV major depression (MD). Correlations were high for age at onset of MD (0.93) and number of episodes (0.70), intermediate for family history (+0.62) and duration of longest episode (+0.43) and variable but generally more modest for individual depressive symptoms (mean kappa = 0.32). Four factors were identified for twelve symptoms from medical records and the same four factors emerged from analysis of structured interviews. Factor congruencies were high but the correlation of factors between interviews and records were modest (i.e. +0.2 to +0.4).Structured interviews and medical records are highly concordant for age of onset, and the number and length of episodes, but agree more modestly for individual symptoms and symptom factors. The modesty of these correlations probably arises from multiple factors including i) inconsistency in the definition of the worst episode, ii) inaccuracies in self-report and iii) difficulties in coding medical records where symptoms were recorded solely for clinical purposes.",
        "In medical practice, diagnostic hypotheses are often made by physicians in the first moments of contact with patients; sometimes even before they report their symptoms. We propose that generation of diagnostic hypotheses in this context is the result of cognitive processes subserved by brain mechanisms that are similar to those involved in naming objects or concepts in everyday life.To test this proposal we developed an experimental paradigm with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using radiological diagnosis as a model. Twenty-five radiologists diagnosed lesions in chest X-ray images and named non-medical targets (animals) embedded in chest X-ray images while being scanned in a fMRI session. Images were presented for 1.5 seconds; response times (RTs) and the ensuing cortical activations were assessed. The mean response time for diagnosing lesions was 1.33 (SD ±0.14) seconds and 1.23 (SD ±0.13) seconds for naming animals. 72% of the radiologists reported cogitating differential diagnoses during trials (3.5 seconds). The overall pattern of cortical activations was remarkably similar for both types of targets. However, within the neural systems shared by both stimuli, activation was significantly greater in left inferior frontal sulcus and posterior cingulate cortex for lesions relative to animals.Generation of diagnostic hypotheses and differential diagnoses made through the immediate visual recognition of clinical signs can be a fast and automatic process. The co-localization of significant brain activation for lesions and animals suggests that generating diagnostic hypotheses for lesions and naming animals are served by the same neuronal systems. Nevertheless, diagnosing lesions was cognitively more demanding and associated with more activation in higher order cortical areas. These results support the hypothesis that medical diagnoses based on prompt visual recognition of clinical signs and naming in everyday life are supported by similar brain systems.",
        "To understand how miRNAs contribute to the molecular phenotype of adipose tissues and related traits, we performed global miRNA expression profiling in subcutaneous abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue of 70 human subjects and characterised which miRNAs were differentially expressed between these tissues. We found that 12% of the miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue (FDR adjusted p<0.05) in the primary study, of which 59 replicated in a follow-up study of 40 additional subjects. Further, 14 miRNAs were found to be associated with metabolic syndrome case-control status in abdominal tissue and three of these replicated (primary study: FDR adjusted p<0.05, replication: p<0.05 and directionally consistent effect). Genome-wide genotyping was performed in the 70 subjects to enable miRNA expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis. Candidate miRNA eQTLs were followed-up in the additional 40 subjects and six significant, independent cis-located miRNA eQTLs (primary study: p<0.001; replication: p<0.05 and directionally consistent effect) were identified. Finally, global mRNA expression profiling was performed in both tissues to enable association analysis between miRNA and target mRNA expression levels. We find 22% miRNAs in abdominal and 9% miRNAs in gluteal adipose tissue with expression levels significantly associated with the expression of corresponding target mRNAs (FDR adjusted p<0.05). Taken together, our results indicate a clear difference in the miRNA molecular phenotypic profile of abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue, that the expressions of some miRNAs are influenced by cis-located genetic variants and that miRNAs are associated with expression levels of their predicted mRNA targets.",
        "Our understanding of the composition of multi-clonal malarial infections and the epidemiological factors which shape their diversity remain poorly understood. Traditionally within-host diversity has been defined in terms of the multiplicity of infection (MOI) derived by PCR-based genotyping. Massively parallel, single molecule sequencing technologies now enable individual read counts to be derived on genome-wide datasets facilitating the development of new statistical approaches to describe within-host diversity. In this class of measures the F(WS) metric characterizes within-host diversity and its relationship to population level diversity. Utilizing P. falciparum field isolates from patients in West Africa we here explore the relationship between the traditional MOI and F(WS) approaches. F(WS) statistics were derived from read count data at 86,158 SNPs in 64 samples sequenced on the Illumina GA platform. MOI estimates were derived by PCR at the msp-1 and -2 loci. Significant correlations were observed between the two measures, particularly with the msp-1 locus (P = 5.92×10(-5)). The F(WS) metric should be more robust than the PCR-based approach owing to reduced sensitivity to potential locus-specific artifacts. Furthermore the F(WS) metric captures information on a range of parameters which influence out-crossing risk including the number of clones (MOI), their relative proportions and genetic divergence. This approach should provide novel insights into the factors which correlate with, and shape within-host diversity.",
        "We have examined the transcriptional response of Caenorhabditis elegans following exposure to the anthelmintic drug ivermectin (IVM) using whole genome microarrays and real-time QPCR. Our original aim was to identify candidate molecules involved in IVM metabolism and/or excretion. For this reason the IVM tolerant strain, DA1316, was used to minimise transcriptomic changes related to the phenotype of drug exposure. However, unlike equivalent work with benzimidazole drugs, very few of the induced genes were members of xenobiotic metabolising enzyme families. Instead, the transcriptional response was dominated by genes associated with fat mobilization and fatty acid metabolism including catalase, esterase, and fatty acid CoA synthetase genes. This is consistent with the reduction in pharyngeal pumping, and consequential reduction in food intake, upon exposure of DA1316 worms to IVM. Genes with the highest fold change in response to IVM exposure, cyp-37B1, mtl-1 and scl-2, were comparably up-regulated in response to short-term food withdrawal (4 hr) independent of IVM exposure, and GFP reporter constructs confirm their expression in tissues associated with fat storage (intestine and hypodermis). These experiments have serendipitously identified novel genes involved in an early response of C. elegans to reduced food intake and may provide insight into similar processes in higher organisms.",
        "The well-established left hemisphere specialisation for language processing has long been claimed to be based on a low-level auditory specialization for specific acoustic features in speech, particularly regarding 'rapid temporal processing'.A novel analysis/synthesis technique was used to construct a variety of sounds based on simple sentences which could be manipulated in spectro-temporal complexity, and whether they were intelligible or not. All sounds consisted of two noise-excited spectral prominences (based on the lower two formants in the original speech) which could be static or varying in frequency and/or amplitude independently. Dynamically varying both acoustic features based on the same sentence led to intelligible speech but when either or both acoustic features were static, the stimuli were not intelligible. Using the frequency dynamics from one sentence with the amplitude dynamics of another led to unintelligible sounds of comparable spectro-temporal complexity to the intelligible ones. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to compare which brain regions were active when participants listened to the different sounds.Neural activity to spectral and amplitude modulations sufficient to support speech intelligibility (without actually being intelligible) was seen bilaterally, with a right temporal lobe dominance. A left dominant response was seen only to intelligible sounds. It thus appears that the left hemisphere specialisation for speech is based on the linguistic properties of utterances, not on particular acoustic features.",
        "Hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule binding protein Tau is a feature of a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Tau is hyperphosphorylated in the hippocampus of dab1-null mice in a strain-dependent manner; however, it has not been clear if the Tau phosphorylation phenotype is a secondary effect of the morbidity of these mutants. The dab1 gene encodes a docking protein that is required for normal brain lamination and dendritogenesis as part of the Reelin signaling pathway. We show that dab1 gene inactivation after brain development leads to Tau hyperphosphorylation in anatomically normal mice. Genomic regions that regulate the phospho Tau phenotype in dab1 mutants have previously been identified. Using a microarray gene expression comparison between dab1-mutants from the high-phospho Tau expressing and low-phospho Tau expressing strains, we identified Stk25 as a differentially expressed modifier of dab1-mutant phenotypes. Stk25 knockdown reduces Tau phosphorylation in embryonic neurons. Furthermore, Stk25 regulates neuronal polarization and Golgi morphology in an antagonistic manner to Dab1. This work provides insights into the complex regulation of neuronal behavior during brain development and provides insights into the molecular cascades that regulate Tau phosphorylation.",
        "In order to characterise the function of the novel fibrillar type XXVII collagen, a series of mice expressing mutant forms of the collagen were investigated. Mice harboring a glycine to cysteine substitution in the collagenous domain were phenotypically normal when heterozygote and displayed a mild disruption of growth plate architecture in the homozygous state. Mice expressing an 87 amino acid deletion in the collagenous domain of collagen XXVII were phenotypically normal as heterozygotes whereas homozygotes exhibited a severe chondrodysplasia and died perinatally from a lung defect. Animals expressing the 87 amino acid deletion targeted specifically to cartilage were viable but severely dwarfed. The pericellular matrix of proliferative chondrocytes was disrupted and the proliferative cells exhibited a decreased tendency to flatten and form vertical columns. Collagen XXVII plays an important structural role in the pericellular extracellular matrix of the growth plate and is required for the organisation of the proliferative zone.",

        "A case of severe Pemphigoid Gestationis (PG), persisted postpartum despite high-dose corticosteroid therapy was reported. Small for gestational age, premature birth, and neonatal convulsions with confirmed central nervous system pathology occurred as an adverse fetal outcome. Is the disease as innocent as described earlier?",
        "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is the result of dysregulation of mucosal innate and adaptive immune responses. Factors such as genetic, microbial and environmental are involved in the development of these disorders. Accordingly, animal models that mimic human diseases are tools for the understanding the immunological processes of the IBD as well as to evaluate new therapeutic strategies. Crotoxin (CTX) is the main component of Crotalus durissus terrificus snake venom and has an immunomodulatory effect. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the modulatory effect of CTX in a murine model of colitis induced by 2,4,6- trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). The CTX was administered intraperitoneally 18 hours after the TNBS intrarectal instillation in BALB/c mice. The CTX administration resulted in decreased weight loss, disease activity index (DAI), macroscopic tissue damage, histopathological score and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity analyzed after 4 days of acute TNBS colitis. Furthermore, the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were lower in colon tissue homogenates of TNBS-mice that received the CTX when compared with untreated TNBS mice. The analysis of distinct cell populations obtained from the intestinal lamina propria showed that CTX reduced the number of group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) and Th17 population; CTX decreased IL-17 secretion but did not alter the frequency of CD4+Tbet+ T cells induced by TNBS instillation in mice. In contrast, increased CD4+FoxP3+ cell population as well as secretion of TGF-β, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and lipoxin A4 (LXA4) was observed in TNBS-colitis mice treated with CTX compared with untreated TNBS-colitis mice. In conclusion, the CTX is able to modulate the intestinal acute inflammatory response induced by TNBS, resulting in the improvement of clinical status of the mice. This effect of CTX is complex and involves the suppression of the pro-inflammatory environment elicited by intrarectal instillation of TNBS due to the induction of a local anti-inflammatory profile in mice.",
        "Bottlenose dolphin stock structure in the northeast Atlantic remains poorly understood. However, fine scale photo-id data have shown that populations can comprise multiple overlapping social communities. These social communities form structural elements of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) [corrected] populations, reflecting specific ecological and behavioural adaptations to local habitats. We investigated the social structure of bottlenose dolphins in the waters of northwest Ireland and present evidence for distinct inshore and offshore social communities. Individuals of the inshore community had a coastal distribution restricted to waters within 3 km from shore. These animals exhibited a cohesive, fission-fusion social organisation, with repeated resightings within the research area, within a larger coastal home range. The offshore community comprised one or more distinct groups, found significantly further offshore (>4 km) than the inshore animals. In addition, dorsal fin scarring patterns differed significantly between inshore and offshore communities with individuals of the offshore community having more distinctly marked dorsal fins. Specifically, almost half of the individuals in the offshore community (48%) had characteristic stereotyped damage to the tip of the dorsal fin, rarely recorded in the inshore community (7%). We propose that this characteristic is likely due to interactions with pelagic fisheries. Social segregation and scarring differences found here indicate that the distinct communities are likely to be spatially and behaviourally segregated. Together with recent genetic evidence of distinct offshore and coastal population structures, this provides evidence for bottlenose dolphin inshore/offshore community differentiation in the northeast Atlantic. We recommend that social communities should be considered as fundamental units for the management and conservation of bottlenose dolphins and their habitat specialisations.",
        "Surveillance and effective management of drug resistance is important to sustaining tuberculosis (TB) control efforts. We aimed to determine resistance rates to first line anti tuberculosis drugs and to describe factors associated with the resistance to any of the first line anti tuberculosis drugs in Dar es Salaam Tanzania.Newly diagnosed, TB patients with neither history of tuberculosis treatment nor isoniazid prophylaxis were included into the study. Sputum specimens were cultured on either mycobacteria growth indicator tube 960 (MGIT 960) or Lowenstein Jenstein (LJ) medium supplemented with either glycerol (GLJ) or pyruvate (PLJ). Drug susceptibility for isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin and ethambutol was determined by either Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium or mycobacteria growth indicator tube 960 (MGIT 960).A total of 933 newly diagnosed TB patients, were included into the study. Multi drug resistance (MDR) tuberculosis was detected among 2 (0.2%) patients. Resistance to any of the four tested drugs was detected among 54 (5.8%) patients. Mono-resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin and ethambutol were 21(2.3%), 3 (0.3%), 13 (1.4%), 9 (1.0%) respectively.Primary resistance to first line anti tuberculosis drugs is still low in this setting. Continued vigilance including periodic national surveillance of anti-tuberculosis resistance is recommended.",
        "There is substantial biochemical, pathological, and genetic evidence that α-synuclein (A-syn) is a principal molecule in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD). We previously reported that total A-syn levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), measured with the specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) developed by ourselves, were decreased in patients with PD, and suggested the usefulness of A-syn in CSF and plasma as a biomarker for the diagnosis of PD. After our report, a considerable number of studies have investigated the levels A-syn in CSF and in blood, but have reported inconclusive results. Such discrepancies have often been attributed not only to the use of different antibodies in the ELISAs but also to interference from hemolysis. In this study we measured the levels of A-syn in CSF and plasma by using our own sandwich ELISA with or without heterophilic antibody (HA) inhibitor in 30 patients with PD and 58 age-matched controls. We thereby revealed that HA interfered with ELISA measurements of A-syn and are accordingly considered to be an important confounder in A-syn ELISAs. HA produced falsely exaggerated signals in A-syn ELISAs more prominently in plasma samples than in CSF samples. After elimination of HA interference, it was found that hemolysis did not have a significant effect on the signals obtained using our A-syn ELISA. Furthermore, plasma levels of A-syn were significantly lower in the PD group compared with the control group following elimination of HA interference with an HA inhibitor. Our results demonstrate that HA was a major confounder that should be controlled in A-syn ELISAs, and that plasma A-syn could be a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of PD if adequately quantified following elimination of HA interference.",
        "Fat deposition is highly correlated with the growth, meat quality, reproductive performance and immunity of pigs. Fatty acid synthesis takes place mainly in the adipose tissue of pigs; therefore, in this study, a high-throughput massively parallel sequencing approach was used to generate adipose tissue transcriptomes from two groups of Songliao black pigs that had opposite backfat thickness phenotypes. The total number of paired-end reads produced for each sample was in the range of 39.29-49.36 millions. Approximately 188 genes were differentially expressed in adipose tissue and were enriched for metabolic processes, such as fatty acid biosynthesis, lipid synthesis, metabolism of fatty acids, etinol, caffeine and arachidonic acid and immunity. Additionally, many genetic variations were detected between the two groups through pooled whole-genome resequencing. Integration of transcriptome and whole-genome resequencing data revealed important genomic variations among the differentially expressed genes for fat deposition, for example, the lipogenic genes. Further studies are required to investigate the roles of candidate genes in fat deposition to improve pig breeding programs.",
        "Childhood trauma is associated with premature declines in health in midlife and old age. Pathways that have been implicated, but less studied include social-emotional regulation, biological programming, and habitual patterns of thought and action. In this study we focused on childhood trauma's influence via alterations in social-emotional regulation to everyday life events, a pathway that has been linked to subsequent health effects. Data from a 30-day daily diary of community residents who participated in a study of resilience in Midlife (n = 191, Mage = 54, SD = 7.50, 54% women) was used to examine whether self-reports of childhood trauma were associated with daily well-being, as well as reported and emotional reactivity to daily negative and positive events. Childhood trauma reports were associated with reporting lower overall levels of and greater variability in daily well-being. Childhood trauma was linked to greater reports of daily negative events, but not to positive events. Focusing on emotional reactivity to daily events, residents who reported higher levels of childhood trauma showed stronger decreases in well-being when experiencing negative events and also stronger increases in well-being with positive events. For those reporting childhood trauma, higher levels of mastery were associated with stronger decreases in well-being with negative events and stronger increases in well-being with positive events, suggesting that mastery increases sensitivity to daily negative and positive events. Our results suggest that childhood trauma may lead to poorer health in midlife through disturbances in the patterns of everyday life events and responses to those events. Further, our findings indicate that mastery may have a different meaning for those who experienced childhood trauma. We discuss social-emotional regulation as one pathway linking childhood trauma to health, and psychosocial resources to consider when building resilience-promoting interventions for mitigating the detrimental health effects of childhood trauma.",
        "The complexes formed by BCL10, MALT1 and specific members of the family of CARMA proteins (CBM complex), have recently focused much attention because they represent a central hub regulating activation of the transcription factor NF-κB following various cellular stimulations. In this manuscript, we report the functional characterization of a Danio rerio 241 amino acids polypeptide ortholog of the Caspase recruiting domain (CARD)-containing protein BCL10. Biochemical studies show that zebrafish Bcl10 (zBcl10) dimerizes and binds to components of the CBM complex. Fluorescence microscopy observations demonstrate that zBcl10 forms cytoplasmic filaments similar to that formed by human BCL10 (hBCL10). Functionally, in human cells zBcl10 is more effective in activating NF-κB compared to hBCL10, possibly due to the lack of carboxy-terminal inhibitory serine residues present in the human protein. Also, depletion experiments carried out through expression of short hairpin RNAs targeting hBCL10 indicate that zBcl10 can functionally replace the human protein. Finally, we show that the zebrafish cell line PAC2 is suitable to carry out reporter assays for monitoring the activation state of NF- kB transcription factor. In conclusion, this work shows that zebrafish may excellently serve as a model organism to study complex and intricate signal transduction pathways, such as those that control NF-κB activation.",
        "Applying distance-to-frontier analysis, we have used 2.9 million patents and population data to assess whether the relative capacity of world countries and major regions to create new knowledge and technology has become globally more equal or less equal between 1990 and 2010. We show with the Gini coefficient that the global distribution of inventors has become more equal between major countries and regions. However, this trend has been largely due to the improved performance of only two major countries, China and India. The worst performing regions, totalling a population of almost 2 billion, are actually falling behind. Our results suggest that substantial parts of the global population have fallen further behind countries at the global frontier in their ability to create new knowledge and inventions, and that the catch-up among the least developed and middle-income countries is highly uneven, prompting questions about the nature and future of the global knowledge economy.",
        "The Central Asian flora plays a significant role in Eurasia and the Northern Hemisphere. Calophaca, a member of this flora, includes eight currently recognized species, and is centered in Central Asia, with some taxa extending into adjacent areas. A phylogenetic analysis of the genus utilizing nuclear ribosomal ITS and plastid trnS-trnG and rbcL sequences was carried out in order to confirm its taxonomic status and reconstruct its evolutionary history.We employed BEAST Bayesian inference for dating, and S-DIVA and BBM for ancestral area reconstruction, to study its spatiotemporal evolution. Our results show that Calophacais monophyletic and nested within Caragana. The divergence time of Calophaca is estimated at ca. 8.0 Ma, most likely driven by global cooling and aridification, influenced by rapid uplift of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau margins.According to ancestral area reconstructions, the genus most likely originated in the Pamir Mountains, a global biodiversity hotspot and hypothesized Tertiary refugium of many Central Asian plant lineages. Dispersals from this location are inferred to the western Tianshan Mountains, then northward to the Tarbagatai Range, eastward to East Asia, and westward to the Caucasus, Russia, and Europe. The spatiotemporal evolution of Calophaca provides a case contributing to an understanding of the flora and biodiversity of the Central Asian mountains and adjacent regions.",
        "This study aims to investigate the potential nanotoxic effects of TiO2 nanoparticles (TNPs) to dams and pups during lactation period. TiO2 nanoparticles are accumulated in mammary glands of lactating mice after i.v. administration. This accumulation of TiO2 NP likely causes a ROS-induced disruption of tight junction of the blood-milk barrier as indicated by the loss of tight junction proteins and the shedding of alveolar epithelial cells. Compared to larger TNPs (50 nm), smaller ones (8 nm) exhibit a higher accumulation in mammary glands and are more potent in causing perturbations to blood-milk barrier. An alarming finding is that the smaller TNPs (8 nm) are transferred from dams to pups through breastfeeding, likely through the disrupted blood-milk barrier. However, during the lactation period, the nutrient quality of milk from dams and the early developmental landmarks of the pups are not affected by above perturbations.",
        "Wildlife as a source of microbial contamination is a food safety concern. Deer feces (scat) have been determined as a point source for Escherichia coli O157:H7 contamination of fresh produce. The ecological role of the scooped scarab (Onthophagus hecate (Panzer)), a generalist dung beetle species common in Maine blueberry fields, was explored as a biological control agent and alternatively as a pathogen vector between deer scat and food. A large-scale field survey of wildlife scat indicated that pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 was present, albeit at a low prevalence (1.9% of samples, n = 318), in the Maine lowbush blueberry agroecosystem. A manipulative field experiment verified that, should contact occur between deer scat and blueberry plants and fruit during the summer, contamination with E. coli O157:H7 can occur and persist for more than 72 h. For both the positive control and an experimental scat inoculation treatment, the levels of the bacterial population decreased over time, but at different rates (treatment x time interaction: F (1.9,18.8) = 358.486, P < 0.0001). The positive control inoculation, which resulted in a higher initial E. coli level on fruit, decayed at a faster rate than inoculation of fruit via scat in the experimental treatment. We conducted 2 laboratory studies to elucidate aspects of dung beetle feeding ecology as it relates to suppression of E. coli O157:H7 from deer scat to lowbush blueberry fruit. In both experiments, dung beetles buried the same amount of scat whether or not the scat was inoculated with the pathogen (F(1,6) = 0.001; P = 0.999 and (F (2,17) = 4.10, P = 0.147). Beetles feeding on E. coli inoculated deer scat were not found to vector the pathogen to fruit. In two studies, beetles lowered the amount of pathogenic E. coli persisting in soils compared to soils without beetles (F (2,9) = 7.757; P = 0.05 and F (2,17) = 8.0621, P = 0.004). Our study suggests that the dung beetle species, Onthophagus hecate, has the potential to contribute to the suppression of E. coli O157:H7 in agricultural landscapes.",
        "Nowadays molecular species delimitation methods promote the identification of species boundaries within complex taxonomic groups by adopting innovative species concepts and theories (e.g. branching patterns, coalescence). As some of them can efficiently deal with large single-locus datasets, they could speed up the process of species discovery compared to more time consuming molecular methods, and benefit from the existence of large public datasets; these methods can also particularly favour scientific research and actions dealing with threatened or economically important taxa. In this study we aim to investigate and clarify the status of economically important moths species belonging to the genus Spodoptera (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae), a complex group in which previous phylogenetic analyses and integrative approaches already suggested the possible occurrence of cryptic species and taxonomic ambiguities. In this work, the effectiveness of innovative (and faster) species delimitation approaches to infer putative species boundaries has been successfully tested in Spodoptera, by processing the most comprehensive dataset (in terms of number of species and specimens) ever achieved; results are congruent and reliable, irrespective of the set of parameters and phylogenetic models applied. Our analyses confirm the existence of three potential new species clusters (for S. exigua (Hübner, 1808), S. frugiperda (J.E. Smith, 1797) and S. mauritia (Boisduval, 1833)) and support the synonymy of S. marima (Schaus, 1904) with S. ornithogalli (Guenée, 1852). They also highlight the ambiguity of the status of S. cosmiodes (Walker, 1858) and S. descoinsi Lalanne-Cassou & Silvain, 1994. This case study highlights the interest of molecular species delimitation methods as valuable tools for species discovery and to emphasize taxonomic ambiguities.",
        "The AP2/ERF family includes a large number of developmentally and physiologically important transcription factors sharing an AP2 DNA-binding domain. Among them DREB1/CBF and DREB2 factors are known as master regulators respectively of cold and heat/osmotic stress responses.The manual annotation of AP2/ERF family from Eucalyptus grandis, Malus, Populus and Vitis genomes allowed a complete phylogenetic study for comparing the structure of this family in woody species and the model Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression profiles of the whole groups of EgrDREB1 and EgrDREB2 were investigated through RNAseq database survey and RT-qPCR analyses.The structure and the size of the AP2/ERF family show a global conservation for the plant species under comparison. In addition to an expansion of the ERF subfamily, the tree genomes mainly differ with respect to the group representation within the subfamilies. With regard to the E. grandis DREB subfamily, an obvious feature is the presence of 17 DREB1/CBF genes, the maximum reported to date for dicotyledons. In contrast, only six DREB2 have been identified, which is similar to the other plants species under study, except for Malus. All the DREB1/CBF and DREB2 genes from E. grandis are expressed in at least one condition and all are heat-responsive. Regulation by cold and drought depends on the genes but is not specific of one group; DREB1/CBF group is more cold-inducible than DREB2 which is mainly drought responsive.These features suggest that the dramatic expansion of the DREB1/CBF group might be related to the adaptation of this evergreen tree to climate changes when it expanded in Australia.",
        "Mammary tumors and malignant breast cancer cell lines over-express the coagulation factor, tissue factor (TF). High expression of TF is associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), the endogenous inhibitor of TF, is constitutively expressed on the endothelium. We hypothesized that TF-expressing tumor cells can bind to immobilized recombinant TFPI, leading to arrest of the tumor cells under shear in vitro. We evaluated the adhesion of breast cancer cells to immobilized TFPI under static and shear conditions (0.35 - 1.3 dyn/cm2). We found that high-TF-expressing breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 (with a TF density of 460,000/cell), but not low TF-expressing MCF-7 (with a TF density of 1,400/cell), adhered to recombinant TFPI, under static and shear conditions. Adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells to TFPI required activated factor VII (FVIIa), but not FX, and was inhibited by a factor VIIa-blocking anti-TF antibody. Under shear, adhesion to TFPI was dependent on the TFPI-coating concentration, FVIIa concentration and shear stress, with no observed adhesion at shear stresses greater than 1.0 dyn/cm2. This is the first study showing that TF-expressing tumor cells can be captured by immobilized TFPI, a ligand constitutively expressed on the endothelium, under low shear in vitro. Based on our results, we hypothesize that TFPI could be a novel ligand mediating the arrest of TF-expressing tumor cells in high TFPI-expressing vessels under conditions of low shear during metastasis.",
        "The objective of this study was to identify new viral biomarkers associated with acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) by complete genomic sequencing of HBV. Hepatitis B virus mutations associated with ACLF were screened by Illumina high-throughput sequencing in twelve ACLF cases and twelve age-matched mild chronic hepatitis B patients, which were validated in 438 chronic hepatitis B patients (80 asymptomatic carriers, 152 mild chronic hepatitis B patients, 102 severe chronic hepatitis B patients and 104 ACLF patients) by direct sequencing. The results of Illumina sequencing showed that the mutations at 7 sites (T216C, G285A, A1846T, G1896A, C1913A/G, A2159G, and A2189C) of 12 ACLF patients were significantly higher than those of 12 controls. In the validation cohorts, a significantly higher ratio of genotype B to C was found in patients with ACLF than in patients with non-ACLF. Multivariate analysis showed that T216C, G1896A, C1913A/G and A2159G/C were independent risk factors for ACLF. C216 in any combination, A/G1913 in any combination, and G/C2159 in any combination had high specificity for ACLF. In summary, T216C and A2159G/C mutations were novel factors independently associated with ACLF. Combined mutations in hepatitis B cases could play important roles in ACLF development.",
        "Health research is one mechanism to improve population-level health and should generally match the health needs of populations. However, there have been limited data to assess the trends in national-level cardiovascular research output, even as cardiovascular disease [CVD] has become the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.We performed a time trends analysis of cardiovascular research publications (1999-2008) downloaded from Web of Knowledge using a iteratively-tested cardiovascular bibliometric filter with >90% precision and recall. We evaluated cardiovascular research publications, five-year running actual citation indices [ACIs], and degree of international collaboration measured through the ratio of the fractional count of addresses from one country against all addresses for each publication.Global cardiovascular publication volume increased from 40 661 publications in 1999 to 55 284 publications in 2008, which represents a 36% increase. The proportion of cardiovascular publications from high-income, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD] countries declined from 93% to 84% of the total share over the study period. High-income, OECD countries generally had higher fractional counts, which suggest less international collaboration, than lower income countries from 1999-2008. There was an inverse relationship between cardiovascular publications and age-standardized CVD morbidity and mortality rates, but a direct, curvilinear relationship between cardiovascular publications and Human Development Index from 1999-2008.Cardiovascular health research output has increased substantially in the past decade, with a greater share of citations being published from low- and middle-income countries. However, low- and middle-income countries with the higher burdens of cardiovascular disease continue to have lower research output than high-income countries, and thus require targeted research investments to improve cardiovascular health.",
        "Previous studies of HIV acquisition in pregnancy have been in specific population groups, such as sero-discordant couples which have shown an increased risk of HIV acquisition during pregnancy and studies of sexually active women where the results have been ambiguous. However these studies are unable to tell us what the overall impact of pregnancy is on HIV acquisition in the general population.Data from six community-based HIV cohorts were pooled to give 2,628 sero-conversions and a total of 178,000 person years of observation. Multiple imputation was used to allow for the uncertainty of exact sero-conversion date in surveillance intervals greater than the length of a pregnancy. Results were combined using Rubin's rules to give appropriate error bounds. The analysis was stratified into two periods: pre- and post- widespread availability of prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services. This allows us to assess whether there is reporting bias relating to a person's knowledge of their own HIV status which would become more widespread in the latter time period.Results suggest that women while pregnant have a lower risk of acquiring HIV infection over all periods (HRR 0.79, 95%CI 0.70-0.89) than women who were not pregnant. There is no evidence for a difference in the rate of HIV acquisition between postpartum and non-pregnant women (HRR 0.92 95%CI 0.84-1.03).Although there may be immunological reasons for increased risk of HIV acquisition during pregnancy, at a population level this study indicates a lower risk of HIV acquisition for pregnant women. Pregnant women may be more likely to be concordant with their current sexual partner than non-pregnant women, i.e. either already HIV positive prior to the pregnancy or if negative at the time of becoming pregnant more likely to have a negative partner.",
        "The Sundarbans tiger inhabits a unique mangrove habitat and are morphologically distinct from the recognized tiger subspecies in terms of skull morphometrics and body size. Thus, there is an urgent need to assess their ecological and genetic distinctiveness and determine if Sundarbans tigers should be defined and managed as separate conservation unit. We utilized nine microsatellites and 3 kb from four mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes to estimate genetic variability, population structure, demographic parameters and visualize historic and contemporary connectivity among tiger populations from Sundarbans and mainland India. We also evaluated the traits that determine exchangeability or adaptive differences among tiger populations. Data from both markers suggest that Sundarbans tiger is not a separate tiger subspecies and should be regarded as Bengal tiger (P. t. tigris) subspecies. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses of the mtDNA data revealed reciprocal monophyly. Genetic differentiation was found stronger for mtDNA than nuclear DNA. Microsatellite markers indicated low genetic variation in Sundarbans tigers (He= 0.58) as compared to other mainland populations, such as northern and Peninsular (Hebetween 0.67- 0.70). Molecular data supports migration between mainland and Sundarbans populations until very recent times. We attribute this reduction in gene flow to accelerated fragmentation and habitat alteration in the landscape over the past few centuries. Demographic analyses suggest that Sundarbans tigers have diverged recently from peninsular tiger population within last 2000 years. Sundarbans tigers are the most divergent group of Bengal tigers, and ecologically non-exchangeable with other tiger populations, and thus should be managed as a separate \"evolutionarily significant unit\" (ESU) following the adaptive evolutionary conservation (AEC) concept.",
        "Global plant trait studies have revealed fundamental trade-offs in plant resource economics. We evaluated such trait trade-offs during secondary succession in two species-rich tropical ecosystems that contrast in precipitation: dry deciduous and wet evergreen forests of Mexico. Species turnover with succession in dry forest largely relates to increasing water availability and in wet forest to decreasing light availability. We hypothesized that while functional trait trade-offs are similar in the two forest systems, the successful plant strategies in these communities will be different, as contrasting filters affect species turnover. Research was carried out in 15 dry secondary forest sites (5-63 years after abandonment) and in 17 wet secondary forest sites (<1-25 years after abandonment). We used 11 functional traits measured on 132 species to make species-trait PCA biplots for dry and wet forest and compare trait trade-offs. We evaluated whether multivariate plant strategies changed during succession, by calculating a 'Community-Weighted Mean' plant strategy, based on species scores on the first two PCA-axes. Trait spectra reflected two main trade-off axes that were similar for dry and wet forest species: acquisitive versus conservative species, and drought avoiding species versus evergreen species with large animal-dispersed seeds. These trait associations were consistent when accounting for evolutionary history. Successional changes in the most successful plant strategies reflected different functional trait spectra depending on the forest type. In dry forest the community changed from having drought avoiding strategies early in succession to increased abundance of evergreen strategies with larger seeds late in succession. In wet forest the community changed from species having mainly acquisitive strategies to those with more conservative strategies during succession. These strategy changes were explained by increasing water availability during dry forest succession and increasing light scarcity during wet forest succession. Although similar trait spectra were observed among dry and wet secondary forest species, the consequences for succession were different resulting from contrasting environmental filters.",
        "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain cancer in adults and there are few effective treatments. GBMs contain cells with molecular and cellular characteristics of neural stem cells that drive tumour growth. Here we compare responses of human glioblastoma-derived neural stem (GNS) cells and genetically normal neural stem (NS) cells to a panel of 160 small molecule kinase inhibitors. We used live-cell imaging and high content image analysis tools and identified JNJ-10198409 (J101) as an agent that induces mitotic arrest at prometaphase in GNS cells but not NS cells. Antibody microarrays and kinase profiling suggested that J101 responses are triggered by suppression of the active phosphorylated form of polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) (phospho T210), with resultant spindle defects and arrest at prometaphase. We found that potent and specific Plk1 inhibitors already in clinical development (BI 2536, BI 6727 and GSK 461364) phenocopied J101 and were selective against GNS cells. Using a porcine brain endothelial cell blood-brain barrier model we also observed that these compounds exhibited greater blood-brain barrier permeability in vitro than J101. Our analysis of mouse mutant NS cells (INK4a/ARF(-/-), or p53(-/-)), as well as the acute genetic deletion of p53 from a conditional p53 floxed NS cell line, suggests that the sensitivity of GNS cells to BI 2536 or J101 may be explained by the lack of a p53-mediated compensatory pathway. Together these data indicate that GBM stem cells are acutely susceptible to proliferative disruption by Plk1 inhibitors and that such agents may have immediate therapeutic value.",
        "Detection of meningococcal carriers is key to understanding the epidemiology of Neisseria meningitidis, yet no gold standard has been established. Here, we directly compare two methods for collecting pharyngeal swabs to identify meningococcal carriers.We conducted cross-sectional surveys of schoolchildren at multiple sites in Africa to compare swabbing the posterior pharynx behind the uvula (U) to swabbing the posterior pharynx behind the uvula plus one tonsil (T). Swabs were cultured immediately and analyzed using molecular methods.One thousand and six paired swab samples collected from schoolchildren in four countries were analyzed. Prevalence of meningococcal carriage was 6.9% (95% CI: 5.4-8.6%) based on the results from both swabs, but the observed prevalence was lower based on one swab type alone. Prevalence based on the T swab or the U swab alone was similar (5.2% (95% CI: 3.8-6.7%) versus 4.9% (95% CI: 3.6-6.4%) respectively (p=0.6)). The concordance between the two methods was 96.3% and the kappa was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.50-0.73), indicating good agreement.These two commonly used methods for collecting pharyngeal swabs provide consistent estimates of the prevalence of carriage, but both methods misclassified carriers to some degree, leading to underestimates of the prevalence.",
        "When performing a skill such as throwing a dart, many different combinations of joint motions suffice to hit the target. The motor system adapts rapidly to reduce bias in the desired outcome (i.e., the first-order moment of the error); however, the essence of skill is to produce movements with less variability (i.e., to reduce the second-order moment). It is easy to see how feedback about success or failure could sculpt performance to achieve this aim. However, it is unclear whether the dimensions responsible for success or failure need to be known explicitly by the subjects, or whether learning can proceed without explicit awareness of the movement parameters that need to change. Here, we designed a redundant, two-dimensional reaching task in which we could selectively manipulate task success and the variability of action outcomes, whilst also manipulating awareness of the dimension along which performance could be improved. Variability was manipulated either by amplifying natural errors, leaving the correlation between the executed movement and the visual feedback intact, or by adding extrinsic noise, decorrelating movement and feedback. We found that explicit, binary, feedback about success or failure was only sufficient for learning when participants were aware of the dimension along which motor behavior had to change. Without such awareness, learning was only present when extrinsic noise was added to the feedback, but not when task success or variability was manipulated in isolation; learning was also much slower. Our results highlight the importance of conscious awareness of the relevant dimension during motor learning, and suggest that higher-order moments of outcome signals are likely to play a significant role in skill learning in complex tasks.",
        "Due to the scale up of antiretroviral therapy, increasing numbers of HIV-infected children are living into adolescence. As these children grow and surpass the immediate threat of death, the issue of informing them of their HIV status arises. This study aimed to understand how perinatally-infected adolescents learn about their HIV-status as well as to examine their preferences for the disclosure process.In-depth interviews were conducted with 31 (14 male, 17 female) perinatally-infected adolescents aged 16-20 at an HIV clinic in Harare, Zimbabwe, and focused on adolescents' experiences of disclosure. In addition, 15 (1 male, 14 female) healthcare workers participated in two focus groups that were centred on healthcare workers' practices surrounding disclosure in the clinic. Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants. A coding frame was developed and major themes were extracted using grounded theory methods.Healthcare workers encouraged caregivers to initiate disclosure in the home environment. However, many adolescents preferred disclosure to take place in the presence of healthcare workers at the clinic because it gave them access to accurate information as well as an environment that made test results seem more credible. Adolescents learned more specific information about living with an HIV-positive status and the meaning of that status from shared experiences among peers at the clinic.HIV-status disclosure to adolescents is distinct from disclosure to younger children and requires tailored, age-appropriate guidelines. Disclosure to this age group in a healthcare setting may help overcome some of the barriers associated with caregivers disclosing in the home environment and make the HIV status seem more credible to an adolescent. The study also highlights the value of peer support among adolescents, which could help reduce the burden of psychosocial care on caregivers and healthcare workers.",
        "Pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) are skeletal disorders resulting from mutations in COMP, matrilin-3 or collagen IX and are characterised by short-limbed dwarfism and premature osteoarthritis. Interestingly, recent reports suggest patients can also manifest with muscle weakness. Here we present a detailed analysis of two mouse models of the PSACH/MED disease spectrum; ΔD469 T3-COMP (PSACH) and V194D matrilin-3 (MED). In grip test experiments T3-COMP mice were weaker than wild-type littermates, whereas V194D mice behaved as controls, confirming that short-limbed dwarfism alone does not contribute to PSACH/MED-related muscle weakness. Muscles from T3-COMP mice showed an increase in centronuclear fibers at the myotendinous junction. T3-COMP tendons became more lax in cyclic testing and showed thicker collagen fibers when compared with wild-type tissue; matrilin-3 mutant tissues were indistinguishable from controls. This comprehensive study of the myopathy associated with PSACH/MED mutations enables a better understanding of the disease progression, confirms that it is genotype specific and that the limb weakness originates from muscle and tendon pathology rather than short-limbed dwarfism itself. Since some patients are primarily diagnosed with neuromuscular symptoms, this study will facilitate better awareness of the differential diagnoses that might be associated with the PSACH/MED spectrum and subsequent care of PSACH/MED patients.",
        "To investigate if the lack of gestational age correction may explain some of the school failure seen in ex-preterm infants.A cohort study based on the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). The primary outcome was a low Key Stage 1 score (KS1) score at age 7 or having special educational needs (SEN). Exposure groups were defined as preterm (<37 weeks gestation, n = 722) or term (37-42 weeks, n = 11,268). Conditional regression models were derived, matching preterm to term infants on date of birth (DOB), expected date of delivery (EDD) or expected date of delivery and year of school entry. Multiple imputation was used to account for missing covariate data.When matching for DOB, infants born preterm had an increased odds of a low KS1 score (OR 1.73 (1.45-2.06)) and this association persisted after adjusting for potential confounders (OR 1.57 (1.25-1.97)). The association persisted in the analysis matching for EDD (fully adjusted OR 1.53 (1.21-1.94)) but attenuated substantially after additionally restricting to those infants who entered school at the same time as the control infants (fully adjusted OR 1.25 (0.98-1.60)). A compatible reduction in the population attributable risk fraction was seen from 4.60% to 2.12%, and year of school entry appeared to modify the association between gestational age and the risk of a poor KS1 score (p = 0.029).This study provides evidence that the school year placement and assessment of ex-preterm infants based on their actual birthday (rather than their EDD) may increase their risk of learning difficulties with corresponding school failure.",
        "An IFN-γ response to M. tuberculosis-specific antigens is an effective biomarker for M. tuberculosis infection but it cannot discriminate between latent TB infection and active TB disease. Combining a number of cytokine/chemokine responses to M. tuberculosis antigens may enable differentiation of latent TB from active disease.Asymptomatic recently-exposed individuals (spouses of TB patients) were recruited and tuberculin skin tested, bled and followed-up for two years. Culture supernatants, from a six-day culture of diluted whole blood samples stimulated with M. tuberculosis-derived PPD or ESAT-6, were measured for IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, TNF-α and CXCL10 using cytokine ELISAs. In addition, 15 patients with sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB were recruited and tested.Spouses with positive IFN-γ responses to M. tuberculosis ESAT-6 (>62.5 pg/mL) and TB patients showed high production of IL-17, CXCL10 and TNF-α. Higher production of IL-10 and IL-17 in response to ESAT-6 was observed in the spouses compared with TB patients while the ratios of IFN-γ/IL-10 and IFN-γ/IL-17 in response to M. tuberculosis-derived PPD were significantly higher in TB patients compared with the spouses. Tuberculin skin test results did not correlate with cytokine responses.CXCL10 and TNF-α may be used as adjunct markers alongside an IFN-γ release assay to diagnose M. tuberculosis infection, and IL-17 and IL-10 production may differentiate individuals with LTBI from active TB.",
        "In alpine Australia, Orthoptera are abundant, dominant herbivores, important prey species, and hosts for parasites and parasitoids. Despite the central role of orthopterans in alpine ecosystems, the impact of parasites on orthopteran populations is under-explored. In this study we describe the relationship between parasite prevalence and host sex, body size and year of collection. We accessed an existing, preserved collection of 640 Kosciuscola tristis collected from across its range between 2007 and 2011. Upon dissection we collected juvenile parasites and used molecular tools to identify them to three families (Nematoda; Mermithidae, and Arthropoda: Diptera: Tachinidae and Sarcophagidae). The prevalence of nematodes ranged from 3.5% to 25.0% and dipterans from 2.4% to 20.0%. Contrary to predictions, we found no associations between parasite prevalence and grasshopper sex or size. Although there was an association between prevalence of both nematodes and dipterans with year of collection, this is likely driven by a small sample size in the first year. Our results provide a foundation for future studies into parasite prevalence within the alpine environment and the abiotic factors that might influence these associations.",
        "Heterozygous glucokinase (GCK) mutations cause a subtype of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (GCK-MODY). Over 600 GCK mutations have been reported of which ∼65% are missense. In many cases co-segregation has not been established and despite the importance of functional studies in ascribing pathogenicity for missense variants these have only been performed for <10% of mutations. The aim of this study was to determine the minimum prevalence of GCK-MODY amongst diabetic subjects in Slovakia by sequencing GCK in 100 Slovakian probands with a phenotype consistent with GCK-MODY and to explore the pathogenicity of identified variants through family and functional studies. Twenty-two mutations were identified in 36 families (17 missense) of which 7 (I110N, V200A, N204D, G258R, F419S, c.580-2A>C, c.1113-1114delGC) were novel. Parental DNA was available for 22 probands (covering 14/22 mutations) and co-segregation established in all cases. Bioinformatic analysis predicted all missense mutations to be damaging. Nine (I110N, V200A, N204D, G223S, G258R, F419S, V244G, L315H, I436N) mutations were functionally evaluated. Basic kinetic analysis explained pathogenicity for 7 mutants which showed reduced glucokinase activity with relative activity indices (RAI) between 0.6 to <0.001 compared to wild-type GCK (1.0). For the remaining 2 mutants additional molecular mechanisms were investigated. Differences in glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP) -mediated-inhibition of GCK were observed for both L315H & I436N when compared to wild type (IC(50) 14.6±0.1 mM & 20.3±1.6 mM vs.13.3±0.1 mM respectively [p<0.03]). Protein instability as assessed by thermal lability studies demonstrated that both L315H and I436N show marked thermal instability compared to wild-type GCK (RAI at 55°C 8.8±0.8% & 3.1±0.4% vs. 42.5±3.9% respectively [p<0.001]). The minimum prevalence of GCK-MODY amongst Slovakian patients with diabetes was 0.03%. In conclusion, we have identified 22 GCK mutations in 36 Slovakian probands and demonstrate that combining family, bioinformatic and functional studies can aid the interpretation of variants identified by molecular diagnostic screening.",
        "Although men and women have similar risk factors for cardiovascular disease, many social behaviors in developing countries differ by sex. Rural-to-urban migrants have different cardiovascular risk profiles than rural or urban dwellers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sex differences with specific cardiovascular risk factors in rural-to-urban migrants.We used the rural-to-urban migrant group of the PERU MIGRANT cross-sectional study to investigate the sex differences in specific cardiovascular risk factors: obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, as well as exposures of socioeconomic status, acculturation surrogates and behavioral characteristics. Logistic regression analysis was used to characterize strength of association between sex and our outcomes adjusting for potential confounders. The sample of migrants was 589 (mean age 46.5 years) and 52.4% were female. In the adjusted models, women were more likely to be obese (OR=5.97; 95%CI: 3.21-11) and have metabolic syndrome (OR=2.22; 95%CI: 1.39-3.55) than men, explaining the greatest variability for obesity and metabolic syndrome but not for hypertension.Our results suggest that interventions for CVD in Peru should be sex-specific and address the unique health needs of migrant populations living in urban shantytowns since the risk factors for obesity and metabolic syndrome differ between males and females.",
        "Among birch pollen allergic patients up to 70% develop allergic reactions to Bet v 1-homologue food allergens such as Api g 1 (celery) or Dau c 1 (carrot), termed as birch pollen-related food allergy. In most cases, specific immunotherapy with birch pollen extracts does not reduce allergic symptoms to the homologue food allergens. We therefore genetically engineered a multi-allergen chimer and tested if mucosal treatment with this construct could represent a novel approach for prevention of birch pollen-related food allergy.BALB/c mice were poly-sensitized with a mixture of Bet v 1, Api g 1 and Dau c 1 followed by a sublingual challenge with carrot, celery and birch pollen extracts. For prevention of allergy sensitization an allergen chimer composed of immunodominant T cell epitopes of Api g 1 and Dau c 1 linked to the whole Bet v 1 allergen, was intranasally applied prior to sensitization.Intranasal pretreatment with the allergen chimer led to significantly decreased antigen-specific IgE-dependent β-hexosaminidase release, but enhanced allergen-specific IgG2a and IgA antibodies. Accordingly, IL-4 levels in spleen cell cultures and IL-5 levels in restimulated spleen and cervical lymph node cell cultures were markedly reduced, while IFN-γ levels were increased. Immunomodulation was associated with increased IL-10, TGF-β and Foxp3 mRNA levels in NALT and Foxp3 in oral mucosal tissues. Treatment with anti-TGF-β, anti-IL10R or anti-CD25 antibodies abrogated the suppression of allergic responses induced by the chimer.Our results indicate that mucosal application of the allergen chimer led to decreased Th2 immune responses against Bet v 1 and its homologue food allergens Api g 1 and Dau c 1 by regulatory and Th1-biased immune responses. These data suggest that mucosal treatment with a multi-allergen vaccine could be a promising treatment strategy to prevent birch pollen-related food allergy.",
        "The provision of high doses of thiamine may prevent thiamine deficiency in the post-partum period of displaced persons.The study aimed to evaluate a supplementation regimen of thiamine mononitrate (100 mg daily) at the antenatal clinics in Maela refugee camp. Women were enrolled during antenatal care and followed after delivery. Samples were collected at 12 weeks post partum. Thiamine diphosphate (TDP) in whole blood and thiamine in breast-milk of 636 lactating women were measured. Thiamine in breast-milk consisted of thiamine monophosphate (TMP) in addition to thiamine, with a mean TMP to total thiamine ratio of 63%. Mean whole blood TDP (130 nmol/L) and total thiamine in breast-milk (755 nmol/L) were within the upper range reported for well-nourished women. The prevalence of women with low whole blood TDP (<65 nmol/L) was 5% and with deficient breast-milk total thiamine (<300 nmol/L) was 4%. Whole blood TDP predicted both breast-milk thiamine and TMP (R(2) = 0.36 and 0.10, p<0.001). A ratio of TMP to total thiamine ≥63% was associated with a 7.5 and 4-fold higher risk of low whole blood TDP and deficient total breast-milk thiamine, respectively. Routine provision of daily 100 mg of thiamine mononitrate post-partum compared to the previous weekly 10 mg of thiamine hydrochloride resulted in significantly higher total thiamine in breast-milk.Thiamine supplementation for lactating women in Maela refugee camp is effective and should be continued. TMP and its ratio to total thiamine in breast-milk, reported for the first time in this study, provided useful information on thiamine status and should be included in future studies of breast-milk thiamine.",
        "The innate recognition of fungi by leukocytes is mediated by pattern recognition receptors (PRR), such as Dectin-1, and is thought to occur at the cell surface triggering intracellular signalling cascades which lead to the induction of protective host responses. In the lung, this recognition is aided by surfactant which also serves to maintain the balance between inflammation and pulmonary function, although the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we have explored pulmonary innate recognition of a variety of fungal particles, including zymosan, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus, and demonstrate that opsonisation with surfactant components can limit inflammation by reducing host-cell fungal interactions. However, we found that this opsonisation does not contribute directly to innate fungal recognition and that this process is mediated through non-opsonic PRRs, including Dectin-1. Moreover, we found that pulmonary inflammatory responses to resting Aspergillus conidia were initiated by these PRRs in acidified phagolysosomes, following the uptake of fungal particles by leukocytes. Our data therefore provides crucial new insights into the mechanisms by which surfactant can maintain pulmonary function in the face of microbial challenge, and defines the phagolysosome as a novel intracellular compartment involved in the innate sensing of extracellular pathogens in the lung.",
        "Plasmodium vivax infections seldom kill directly but do cause indirect mortality by reducing birth weight and causing abortion. Cytoadherence and sequestration in the microvasculature are central to the pathogenesis of severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria, but the contribution of cytoadherence to pathology in other human malarias is less clear.The adherence properties of P. vivax infected red blood cells (PvIRBC) were evaluated under static and flow conditions.P. vivax isolates from 33 patients were studied. None adhered to immobilized CD36, ICAM-1, or thrombospondin, putative ligands for P. falciparum vascular cytoadherence, or umbilical vein endothelial cells, but all adhered to immobilized chondroitin sulphate A (CSA) and hyaluronic acid (HA), the receptors for adhesion of P. falciparum in the placenta. PvIRBC also adhered to fresh placental cells (N = 5). Pre-incubation with chondroitinase prevented PvIRBC adherence to CSA, and reduced binding to HA, whereas preincubation with hyaluronidase prevented adherence to HA, but did not reduce binding to CSA significantly. Pre-incubation of PvIRBC with soluble CSA and HA reduced binding to the immobilized receptors and prevented placental binding. PvIRBC adhesion was prevented by pre-incubation with trypsin, inhibited by heparin, and reduced by EGTA. Under laminar flow conditions the mean (SD) shear stress reducing maximum attachment by 50% was 0.06 (0.02) Pa but, having adhered, the PvIRBC could then resist detachment by stresses up to 5 Pa. At 37 °C adherence began approximately 16 hours after red cell invasion with maximal adherence at 30 hours. At 39 °C adherence began earlier and peaked at 24 hours.Adherence of P. vivax-infected erythrocytes to glycosaminoglycans may contribute to the pathogenesis of vivax malaria and lead to intrauterine growth retardation.",
        "We investigated whether previously reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of EPHA2 in European studies are associated with cataract in India.We carried out a population-based genetic association study. We enumerated randomly sampled villages in two areas of north and south India to identify people aged 40 and over. Participants attended a clinical examination including lens photography and provided a blood sample for genotyping. Lens images were graded by the Lens Opacification Classification System (LOCS III). Cataract was defined as a LOCS III grade of nuclear ≥4, cortical ≥3, posterior sub-capsular (PSC) ≥2, or dense opacities or aphakia/pseudophakia in either eye. We genotyped SNPs rs3754334, rs7543472 and rs11260867 on genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using TaqMan assays in an ABI 7900 real-time PCR. We used logistic regression with robust standard errors to examine the association between cataract and the EPHA2 SNPs, adjusting for age, sex and location.7418 participants had data on at least one of the SNPs investigated. Genotype frequencies of controls were in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (p>0.05). There was no association of rs3754334 with cataract or type of cataract. Minor allele homozygous genotypes of rs7543472 and rs11260867 compared to the major homozygote genotype were associated with cortical cataract, Odds ratio (OR) = 1.8, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) (1.1, 3.1) p = 0.03 and 2.9 (1.2, 7.1) p = 0.01 respectively, and with PSC cataract, OR = 1.5 (1.1, 2.2) p = 0.02 and 1.8 (0.9, 3.6) p = 0.07 respectively. There was no consistent association of SNPs with nuclear cataract or a combined variable of any type of cataract including operated cataract.Our results in the Indian population agree with previous studies of the association of EPHA2 variants with cortical cataracts. We report new findings for the association with PSC which is particularly prevalent in Indians.",
        "Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) accounts for two million deaths worldwide annually. In those hospitalised with SAM, concomitant infections and diarrhoea are frequent complications resulting in adverse outcome. We examined the clinical and laboratory features on admission and outcome of children with SAM and diarrhoea at a Kenyan district hospital.A 4-year prospective descriptive study involving 1,206 children aged 6 months to 12 years, hospitalized with SAM and managed in accordance with WHO guidelines. Data on clinical features, haematological, biochemical and microbiological findings for children with diarrhoea (≥ 3 watery stools/day) were systematically collected and analyzed to identify risk factors associated with poor outcome.At admission 592 children (49%) had diarrhoea of which 122 (21%) died compared to 72/614 (12%) deaths in those without diarrhoea at admission (Χ(2) = 17.6 p<0.001). A further 187 (16%) children developed diarrhoea after 48 hours of admission and 33 died (18%). Any diarrhoea during admission resulted in a significantly higher mortality 161/852 (19%) than those uncomplicated by diarrhoea 33/351 (9%) (Χ(2) = 16.6 p<0.001). Features associated with a fatal outcome in children presenting with diarrhoea included bacteraemia, hyponatraemia, low mid-upper arm circumference <10 cm, hypoxia, hypokalaemia and oedema. Bacteraemia had the highest risk of death (adjusted OR 6.1; 95% C.I 2.3, 16.3 p<0.001); and complicated 24 (20%) of fatalities. Positive HIV antibody status was more frequent in cases with diarrhoea at admission (23%) than those without (15%, Χ(2) = 12.0 p = 0.001) but did not increase the risk of death in diarrhoea cases.Children with SAM complicated by diarrhoea had a higher risk of death than those who did not have diarrhoea during their hospital stay. Further operational and clinical research is needed to reduce mortality in children with SAM in the given setting.",
        "Epigenetic markings acquired in early life may have phenotypic consequences later in development through their role in transcriptional regulation with relevance to the developmental origins of diseases including obesity. The goal of this study was to investigate whether DNA methylation levels at birth are associated with body size later in childhood.A study design involving two birth cohorts was used to conduct transcription profiling followed by DNA methylation analysis in peripheral blood. Gene expression analysis was undertaken in 24 individuals whose biological samples and clinical data were collected at a mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of 12.35 (0.95) years, the upper and lower tertiles of body mass index (BMI) were compared with a mean (SD) BMI difference of 9.86 (2.37) kg/m(2). This generated a panel of differentially expressed genes for DNA methylation analysis which was then undertaken in cord blood DNA in 178 individuals with body composition data prospectively collected at a mean (SD) age of 9.83 (0.23) years. Twenty-nine differentially expressed genes (>1.2-fold and p<10(-4)) were analysed to determine DNA methylation levels at 1-3 sites per gene. Five genes were unmethylated and DNA methylation in the remaining 24 genes was analysed using linear regression with bootstrapping. Methylation in 9 of the 24 (37.5%) genes studied was associated with at least one index of body composition (BMI, fat mass, lean mass, height) at age 9 years, although only one of these associations remained after correction for multiple testing (ALPL with height, p(Corrected) = 0.017).DNA methylation patterns in cord blood show some association with altered gene expression, body size and composition in childhood. The observed relationship is correlative and despite suggestion of a mechanistic epigenetic link between in utero life and later phenotype, further investigation is required to establish causality.",
        "The insulin (INS) region is the second most important locus associated with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). The study of the DNA methylation pattern of the 7 CpGs proximal to the TSS in the INS gene promoter revealed that T1D patients have a lower level of methylation of CpG -19, -135 and -234 (p = 2.10(-16)) and a higher methylation of CpG -180 than controls, while methylation was comparable for CpG -69, -102, -206. The magnitude of the hypomethylation relative to a control population was 8-15% of the corresponding levels in controls and was correlated in CpGs -19 and -135 (r = 0.77) and CpG -135 and -234 (r = 0.65). 70/485 (14%) of T1D patients had a simultaneous decrease in methylation of CpG -19, -135, -234 versus none in 317 controls. CpG methylation did not correlate with glycated hemoglobin or with T1D duration. The methylation of CpG -69, -102, -180, -206, but not CpG -19, -135, -234 was strongly influenced by the cis-genotype at rs689, a SNP known to show a strong association with T1D. We hypothesize that part of this genetic association could in fact be mediated at the statistical and functional level by the underlying changes in neighboring CpG methylation. Our observation of a CpG-specific, locus-specific methylation pattern, although it can provide an epigenetic biomarker of a multifactorial disease, does not indicate whether the reported epigenetic pattern preexists or follows the establishment of T1D. To explore the effect of chronic hyperglycemia on CpG methylation, we studied non obese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who were found to have decreased CpG-19 methylation versus age-matched controls, similar to T1D (p = 2.10(-6)) but increased CpG-234 methylation (p = 5.10(-8)), the opposite of T1D. The causality and natural history of the different epigenetic changes associated with T1D or T2D remain to be determined.",
        "Several different interventions improve depressed mood, including medication and environmental factors such as regular physical exercise. The molecular pathways underlying these effects are still not fully understood. In this study, we sought to identify shared mechanisms underlying antidepressant interventions. We studied three groups of mice: mice treated with a widely used antidepressant drug--fluoxetine, mice engaged in voluntary exercise, and mice living in an enriched environment. The hippocampi of treated mice were investigated at the molecular and cellular levels. Mice treated with fluoxetine and mice who exercised daily showed, not only similar antidepressant behavior, but also similar changes in gene expression and hippocampal neurons. These changes were not observed in mice with environmental enrichment. An increase in neurogenesis and dendritic spine density was observed following four weeks of fluoxetine treatment and voluntary exercise. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed four different modules of co-expressed genes that were correlated with the antidepressant effect. This network analysis enabled us to identify genes involved in the molecular pathways underlying the effects of fluoxetine and exercise. The existence of both neuronal and gene expression changes common to antidepressant drug and exercise suggests a shared mechanism underlying their effect. Further studies of these findings may be used to uncover the molecular mechanisms of depression, and to identify new avenues of therapy.",
        "Copy number variations (CNVs) are genomic regions that have added (duplications) or deleted (deletions) genetic material. They may overlap genes affecting their function and have been shown to be associated with disease. We previously investigated the role of CNVs in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and National Institute of Aging-Late Onset AD/National Cell Repository for AD (NIA-LOAD/NCRAD) Family Study participants, and identified a number of genes overlapped by CNV calls. To confirm the findings and identify other potential candidate regions, we analyzed array data from a unique cohort of 1617 Caucasian participants (1022 AD cases and 595 controls) who were clinically characterized and whose diagnosis was neuropathologically verified. All DNA samples were extracted from brain tissue. CNV calls were generated and subjected to quality control (QC). 728 cases and 438 controls who passed all QC measures were included in case/control association analyses including candidate gene and genome-wide approaches. Rates of deletions and duplications did not significantly differ between cases and controls. Case-control association identified a number of previously reported regions (CHRFAM7A, RELN and DOPEY2) as well as a new gene (HLA-DRA). Meta-analysis of CHRFAM7A indicated a significant association of the gene with AD and/or MCI risk (P = 0.006, odds ratio = 3.986 (95% confidence interval 1.490-10.667)). A novel APP gene duplication was observed in one case sample. Further investigation of the identified genes in independent and larger samples is warranted.",
        "The canonical flow of visual signals proceeds from outer to inner retina (photoreceptors → bipolar cells → ganglion cells). However, melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells are photosensitive and functional sustained light signaling to retinal dopaminergic interneurons persists in the absence of rods and cones. Here we show that the sustained-type light response of retinal dopamine neurons requires melanopsin and that the response is mediated by AMPA-type glutamate receptors, defining a retrograde retinal visual signaling pathway that fully reverses the usual flow of light signals in retinal circuits.",
        "We present a method to discover discriminative brain metabolism patterns in [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) scans, facilitating the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In the work, the term \"pattern\" stands for a certain brain region that characterizes a target group of patients and can be used for a classification as well as interpretation purposes. Thus, it can be understood as a so-called \"region of interest (ROI)\". In the literature, an ROI is often found by a given brain atlas that defines a number of brain regions, which corresponds to an anatomical approach. The present work introduces a semi-data-driven approach that is based on learning the characteristics of the given data, given some prior anatomical knowledge. A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and model selection are combined to return a clustering of voxels that may serve for the definition of ROIs. Experiments on both an in-house dataset and data of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) suggest that the proposed approach arrives at a better diagnosis than a merely anatomical approach or conventional statistical hypothesis testing.",
        "Efficient allocation of resources to intervene against malaria requires a detailed understanding of the contemporary spatial distribution of malaria risk. It is exactly 40 y since the last global map of malaria endemicity was published. This paper describes the generation of a new world map of Plasmodium falciparum malaria endemicity for the year 2007.A total of 8,938 P. falciparum parasite rate (PfPR) surveys were identified using a variety of exhaustive search strategies. Of these, 7,953 passed strict data fidelity tests for inclusion into a global database of PfPR data, age-standardized to 2-10 y for endemicity mapping. A model-based geostatistical procedure was used to create a continuous surface of malaria endemicity within previously defined stable spatial limits of P. falciparum transmission. These procedures were implemented within a Bayesian statistical framework so that the uncertainty of these predictions could be evaluated robustly. The uncertainty was expressed as the probability of predicting correctly one of three endemicity classes; previously stratified to be an informative guide for malaria control. Population at risk estimates, adjusted for the transmission modifying effects of urbanization in Africa, were then derived with reference to human population surfaces in 2007. Of the 1.38 billion people at risk of stable P. falciparum malaria, 0.69 billion were found in Central and South East Asia (CSE Asia), 0.66 billion in Africa, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia (Africa+), and 0.04 billion in the Americas. All those exposed to stable risk in the Americas were in the lowest endemicity class (PfPR2-10 < or = 5%). The vast majority (88%) of those living under stable risk in CSE Asia were also in this low endemicity class; a small remainder (11%) were in the intermediate endemicity class (PfPR2-10 > 5 to < 40%); and the remaining fraction (1%) in high endemicity (PfPR2-10 > or = 40%) areas. High endemicity was widespread in the Africa+ region, where 0.35 billion people are at this level of risk. Most of the rest live at intermediate risk (0.20 billion), with a smaller number (0.11 billion) at low stable risk.High levels of P. falciparum malaria endemicity are common in Africa. Uniformly low endemic levels are found in the Americas. Low endemicity is also widespread in CSE Asia, but pockets of intermediate and very rarely high transmission remain. There are therefore significant opportunities for malaria control in Africa and for malaria elimination elsewhere. This 2007 global P. falciparum malaria endemicity map is the first of a series with which it will be possible to monitor and evaluate the progress of this intervention process.",
        "Migration from rural areas of India contributes to urbanisation and may increase the risk of obesity and diabetes. We tested the hypotheses that rural-to-urban migrants have a higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes than rural nonmigrants, that migrants would have an intermediate prevalence of obesity and diabetes compared with life-long urban and rural dwellers, and that longer time since migration would be associated with a higher prevalence of obesity and of diabetes.The place of origin of people working in factories in north, central, and south India was identified. Migrants of rural origin, their rural dwelling sibs, and those of urban origin together with their urban dwelling sibs were assessed by interview, examination, and fasting blood samples. Obesity, diabetes, and other cardiovascular risk factors were compared. A total of 6,510 participants (42% women) were recruited. Among urban, migrant, and rural men the age- and factory-adjusted percentages classified as obese (body mass index [BMI] >25 kg/m(2)) were 41.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 39.1-44.7), 37.8% (95% CI 35.0-40.6), and 19.0% (95% CI 17.0-21.0), respectively, and as diabetic were 13.5% (95% CI 11.6-15.4), 14.3% (95% CI 12.2-16.4), and 6.2% (95% CI 5.0-7.4), respectively. Findings for women showed similar patterns. Rural men had lower blood pressure, lipids, and fasting blood glucose than urban and migrant men, whereas no differences were seen in women. Among migrant men, but not women, there was weak evidence for a lower prevalence of both diabetes and obesity among more recent (</=10 y) migrants.Migration into urban areas is associated with increases in obesity, which drive other risk factor changes. Migrants have adopted modes of life that put them at similar risk to the urban population. Gender differences in some risk factors by place of origin are unexpected and require further exploration.

        "Poisoning with organophosphorus (OP) insecticides is a major global public health problem, causing an estimated 200,000 deaths each year. Although the World Health Organization recommends use of pralidoxime, this antidote's effectiveness remains unclear. We aimed to determine whether the addition of pralidoxime chloride to atropine and supportive care offers benefit.We performed a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial of pralidoxime chloride (2 g loading dose over 20 min, followed by a constant infusion of 0.5 g/h for up to 7 d) versus saline in patients with organophosphorus insecticide self-poisoning. Mortality was the primary outcome; secondary outcomes included intubation, duration of intubation, and time to death. We measured baseline markers of exposure and pharmacodynamic markers of response to aid interpretation of clinical outcomes. Two hundred thirty-five patients were randomised to receive pralidoxime (121) or saline placebo (114). Pralidoxime produced substantial and moderate red cell acetylcholinesterase reactivation in patients poisoned by diethyl and dimethyl compounds, respectively. Mortality was nonsignificantly higher in patients receiving pralidoxime: 30/121 (24.8%) receiving pralidoxime died, compared with 18/114 (15.8%) receiving placebo (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-3.26, p = 0.12). Incorporating the baseline amount of acetylcholinesterase already aged and plasma OP concentration into the analysis increased the HR for patients receiving pralidoxime compared to placebo, further decreasing the likelihood that pralidoxime is beneficial. The need for intubation was similar in both groups (pralidoxime 26/121 [21.5%], placebo 24/114 [21.1%], adjusted HR 1.27 [95% CI 0.71-2.29]). To reduce confounding due to ingestion of different insecticides, we further analysed patients with confirmed chlorpyrifos or dimethoate poisoning alone, finding no evidence of benefit.Despite clear reactivation of red cell acetylcholinesterase in diethyl organophosphorus pesticide poisoned patients, we found no evidence that this regimen improves survival or reduces need for intubation in patients with organophosphorus insecticide poisoning. The reason for this failure to benefit patients was not apparent. Further studies of different dose regimens or different oximes are required.",
        "Data on absolute risks of outcomes and patterns of drug use in cost-effectiveness analyses are often based on randomised clinical trials (RCTs). The objective of this study was to evaluate the external validity of published cost-effectiveness studies by comparing the data used in these studies (typically based on RCTs) to observational data from actual clinical practice. Selective Cox-2 inhibitors (coxibs) were used as an example.The UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD) was used to estimate the exposure characteristics and individual probabilities of upper gastrointestinal (GI) events during current exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or coxibs. A basic cost-effectiveness model was developed evaluating two alternative strategies: prescription of a conventional NSAID or coxib. Outcomes included upper GI events as recorded in GPRD and hospitalisation for upper GI events recorded in the national registry of hospitalisations (Hospital Episode Statistics) linked to GPRD. Prescription costs were based on the prescribed number of tables as recorded in GPRD and the 2006 cost data from the British National Formulary. The study population included over 1 million patients prescribed conventional NSAIDs or coxibs. Only a minority of patients used the drugs long-term and daily (34.5% of conventional NSAIDs and 44.2% of coxibs), whereas coxib RCTs required daily use for at least 6-9 months. The mean cost of preventing one upper GI event as recorded in GPRD was US$104k (ranging from US$64k with long-term daily use to US$182k with intermittent use) and US$298k for hospitalizations. The mean costs (for GPRD events) over calendar time were US$58k during 1990-1993 and US$174k during 2002-2005. Using RCT data rather than GPRD data for event probabilities, the mean cost was US$16k with the VIGOR RCT and US$20k with the CLASS RCT.The published cost-effectiveness analyses of coxibs lacked external validity, did not represent patients in actual clinical practice, and should not have been used to inform prescribing policies. External validity should be an explicit requirement for cost-effectiveness analyses.",
        "This research resulted from the determination that MCZ 8791 is a specimen of Deinonychus antirrhopus between one and two years of age and that the morphological variations within particular growth stages of this taxon have yet to be described. The primary goal of the research is to identify ontogenetic variations in this taxon. Histological analyses determined that the Deinonychus specimens AMNH 3015 and MOR 1178 were adults. Comparisons are made between MCZ 8791 and these adult specimens. The holotype, YPM 5205, and the other associated specimens of this taxon within the YPM collection are similar in size and morphology to AMNH 3015. Further comparisons were made with the three partial specimens OMNH 50268, MCZ 4371, and MOR 1182. Although these specimens represent only a partial ontogenetic series, a number of morphological variations can be described. One secondary goal of this research is to compare the known pattern of variable, informative, ontogenetic characters in MCZ 8791 to a similar pattern of morphological characters in the sub-adult dromaeosaurid specimen Bambiraptor feinbergorum, AMNH FR: 30556. If the characters that have been determined to represent variable juvenile morphology in the ontogeny of Deinonychus are exhibited in Bambiraptor, this study will begin the process of determining whether a similar, conservative, ontogenetic pattern exists throughout the rest of Dromaeosauridae. If defensible, it may reduce the number of sympatric taxa within this clade. The other secondary goal relates to the forelimb function. The approximate body size, forelimb length, wrist development, and the presence of a more prominent olecranon on the ulna of MCZ 8791 support the hypothesis that juveniles of this taxon possessed some form of flight capability.",
        "Algae are at the base of the aquatic food chain, producing the food resources that fish are adapted to consume. Previous studies have proven that the inclusion of small amounts (<10% of the diet) of algae in fish feed (aquafeed) resulted in positive effects in growth performance and feed utilisation efficiency. Marine algae have also been shown to possess functional activities, helping in the mediation of lipid metabolism, and therefore are increasingly studied in human and animal nutrition. The aim of this study was to assess the potentials of two commercially available algae derived products (dry algae meal), Verdemin (derived from Ulva ohnoi) and Rosamin (derived from diatom Entomoneis spp.) for their possible inclusion into diet of Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar). Fish performances, feed efficiency, lipid metabolism and final product quality were assessed to investigated the potential of the two algae products (in isolation at two inclusion levels, 2.5% and 5%, or in combination), in experimental diets specifically formulated with low fish meal and fish oil content. The results indicate that inclusion of algae product Verdemin and Rosamin at level of 2.5 and 5.0% did not cause any major positive, nor negative, effect in Atlantic Salmon growth and feed efficiency. An increase in the omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LC-PUFA) content in whole body of fish fed 5% Rosamin was observed.",
        "Although increased prevalence of transfusion transmissible infections (TTI) among \"men who have sex with men\" (MSM) has been well documented, the exclusion of MSM as blood donors is contested. The aim of this systematic review is to find studies that describe the risk of TTI in MSM blood donors.We searched MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cinahl, and Web of Science, and used GRADE for determining evidence quality. We included studies comparing MSM and non-MSM blood donors (or people eligible to give blood), living in areas most relevant for our Blood Service.Out of 18 987 articles, 14 observational studies were included. Two studies directly compared MSM with non-MSM donors showing that MSM donors have a statistically significant higher risk of HIV-1 infections. In one of these studies it was shown that this was related to recent (< 12 months) MSM contact. In two additional studies no evidence was shown in favour of a certain deferral period for MSM. Ten studies, applying permanent deferral for MSM, compared infected versus non-infected donors. One study found that MSM is a statistically significant risk factor for HIV-1 infection in blood donors. For other TTI such as HBV or HCV, an increased risk of infection could not be demonstrated, because the precision of the results was affected by the low numbers of donors with MSM as risk factor, or because of risk of bias in the included studies. All studies included low level evidence, because of risk of bias and imprecision of the results.High-quality studies investigating the risk of TTI in MSM who donate blood are scarce. The available evidence suggests a link between MSM blood donors and HIV-1 infection, but is too limited to be able to unambiguously/clearly recommend a certain deferral policy.",
        "Despite the marked increase of diverticulosis, its risk factors have not been adequately elucidated. We therefore aim to identify significantly associated factors with diverticulosis. We also aim to investigate the present state of diverticulosis in Japan.We reviewed the medical records from 1990 to 2010 that included the data of consecutive 62,503 asymptomatic colonoscopy examinees from the general population in Japan. Most recent 3,327 examinees were analyzed with 16 background factors.Among the 62,503 subjects (47,325 men and 15,178 women; 52.1 ± 9.2 years old), diverticulosis was detected in 11,771 subjects (18.8%; 10,023 men and 1,748 women). The incidences of diverticulosis in 1990-2000 and 2001-2010 were respectively 13.0% (3,771 of 29,071) and 23.9% (8,000 of 33,432): the latter was much higher than the former in all age groups and for both genders. Considering the anatomical locations of colorectal diverticula, left-sided ones have markedly increased with age but not significantly changed with times. Univariate analyses of the 3,327 subjects showed significant association of diverticulosis with four basic factors (age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure), three life style-related factor (smoking, drinking, severe weight increase in adulthood), and two blood test values (triglyceride, HbA1c). The multiple logistic analysis calculating standardized coefficients (β) and odds ratio (OR) demonstrated that age (β = 0.217-0.674, OR = 1.24-1.96), male gender (β = 0.185, OR = 1.20), smoking (β = 0.142-0.200, OR = 1.15-1.22), severe weight increase in adulthood (β = 0.153, OR = 1.17), HbA1c (β = 0.136, OR = 1.15), drinking (β = 0.109, OR = 1.11), and serum triglyceride (β = 0.098, OR = 1.10) showed significantly positive association with diverticulosis whereas body mass index and blood pressure did not.The large-scale data of asymptomatic colonoscopy examinees from the general population from 1990 to 2010 indicated that the prevalence of diverticulosis is still increasing in Japan. Age, male gender, smoking, severe weight increase in adulthood, serum HbA1c, drinking, and serum triglyceride showed significant positive association with diverticulosis.",
        "Although cell therapy of the failing heart by intramyocardial injections of myoblasts to results in regenerative benefit, it has also been associated with undesired and prospectively fatal arrhythmias. We hypothesized that intramyocardial injections of myoblasts could enhance inflammatory reactivity and facilitate electrical cardiac abnormalities that can be reduced by epicardial myoblast sheet delivery. In a rat model of ischemic heart failure, myoblast therapy either by intramyocardial injections or epicardial cell sheets was given 2 weeks after occlusion of the coronary artery. Ventricular premature contractions (VPCs) were assessed, using an implanted three-lead electrocardiograph at 1, 7, and 14 days after therapy, and 16-point epicardial electropotential mapping (EEPM) was used to evaluate ventricular arrhythmogenicity under isoproterenol stress. Cardiac functioning was assessed by echocardiography. Both transplantation groups showed therapeutic benefit over sham therapy. However, VPCs were more frequent in the Injection group on day 1 and day 14 after therapy than in animals receiving epicardial or sham therapy (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). EEPM under isoproterenol stress showed macroreentry at the infarct border area, leading to ventricular tachycardias in the Injection group, but not in the myoblast sheet- or sham-treated groups (p = 0.045). Both transplantation types modified the myocardial cytokine expression profile. In animals receiving epicardial myoblast therapy, selective reductions in the expressions of interferon gamma, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL12 were observed, accompanied by reduced infiltration of inflammatory CD11b- and CD68-positive leukocytes, compared with animals receiving myoblasts as intramyocardial injections. Intramyocardial myoblast delivery was associated with enhanced inflammatory and immunomodulatory reactivity and increased frequency of VPCs. In comparison to intramyocardial injection, the epicardial route may serve as the preferred method of skeletal myoblast transplantation to treat heart failure.",
        "The Ireviken event was one of the most intense extinction episodes that occurred during the mid-Paleozoic era. It had a strong global effect on a range of clades, with conodonts, graptolites and chitinozoans affected most. Using geophysical proxies and conodont species parameters of their temporal abundance structure we investigate how they affected the selectivity of conodont species survival during this calamity. After performing bivariate logistic analyses on 34 species of conodonts, we find three variables that were statistically significantly associated with their odds of survival. These namely include spectral exponents that describe degrees of autocorrelation in a time series, the skewness of species abundance distribution, and average environmental preferences, which are mostly determined by ancient water depths at sampling sites. Model selection of multivariate logistic models found the best model includes species local abundance skewness and substrate preference. A similar pattern is revealed through the regression tree analysis. The apparent extinction selectivity points to a possible causes of environmental deterioration during the Ireviken event. The significant positive relationship between extinction risk and preferential existence in deeper environments suggests the open ocean causal mechanisms of biotic stress that occurred during the Ireviken event. Marine regressions, which were previously suggested as a causal factor in this extinction episode, on theoretical grounds should have had higher impact on species living in near-shore environments, through the processes of habitat loss which are associated with decreases of shelfal areas. In addition, the significant positive correlations found between skewness of abundance distributions and spectral exponent values and the probability of species survival suggest that community and ecosystem processes (which controlled species abundance fluctuation patterns) were significantly related to selectivity processes of this smaller mass extinction event.",
        "Dilated cardiomyopathy is a disease of left ventricular dysfunction accompanied by impairment of the β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR) signal cascade. The disturbed β1-AR function may be based on an elevated sympathetic tone observed in patients with heart failure. Prolonged adrenergic stimulation may induce metabolic and electrophysiological disturbances in the myocardium, resulting in tachyarrhythmia that leads to the development of heart failure in human and sudden death. Hence, β1-AR is considered as a promising drug target but attempts to develop effective and specific drug against this tempting pharmaceutical target is slowed down due to the lack of 3D structure of Homo sapiens β1-AR (hsβADR1). This study encompasses elucidation of 3D structural and physicochemical properties of hsβADR1 via threading-based homology modeling. Furthermore, the docking performance of several docking programs including Surflex-Dock, FRED, and GOLD were validated by re-docking and cross-docking experiments. GOLD and Surflex-Dock performed best in re-docking and cross docking experiments, respectively. Consequently, Surflex-Dock was used to predict the binding modes of four hsβADR1 agonists. This study provides clear understanding of hsβADR1 structure and its binding mechanism, thus help in providing the remedial solutions of cardiovascular, effective treatment of asthma and other diseases caused by malfunctioning of the target protein.",
        "Inhibition of carcinogenesis may be a consequence of attenuation of oxidative stress via activation of antioxidant defence system, restoration and stabilization of tumour suppressor proteins along with modulation of inflammatory mediators. Previously we have delineated significant role of curcumin during its long term effect in regulation of glycolytic pathway and angiogenesis, which in turn results in prevention of cancer via modulation of stress activated genes. Present study was designed to investigate long term effect of curcumin in regulation of Nrf2 mediated phase-II antioxidant enzymes, tumour suppressor p53 and inflammation under oxidative tumour microenvironment in liver of T-cell lymphoma bearing mice. Inhibition of Nrf2 signalling observed during lymphoma progression, resulted in down regulation of phase II antioxidant enzymes, p53 as well as activation of inflammatory signals. Curcumin potentiated significant increase in Nrf2 activation. It restored activity of phase-II antioxidant enzymes like GST, GR, NQO1, and tumour suppressor p53 level. In addition, curcumin modulated inflammation via upregulation of TGF-β and reciprocal regulation of iNOS and COX2. The study suggests that during long term effect, curcumin leads to prevention of cancer by inducing phase-II antioxidant enzymes via activation of Nrf2 signalling, restoration of tumour suppressor p53 and modulation of inflammatory mediators like iNOS and COX2 in liver of lymphoma bearing mice.",
        "Many anti-cancer drugs fail in human trials despite showing efficacy in preclinical models. It is clear that the in vitro assays involving 2D monoculture do not reflect the complex extracellular matrix, chemical, and cellular microenvironment of the tumor tissue, and this may explain the failure of 2D models to predict clinical efficacy. We first optimized an in vitro microtumor model using a tumor-aligned ECM, a tumor-aligned medium, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer spheroids, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and human stromal cells to recapitulate the tissue architecture, chemical environment, and cellular organization of a growing and invading tumor. We assayed the microtumor for cell proliferation and invasion in a tumor-aligned extracellular matrix, exhibiting collagen deposition, acidity, glucose deprivation, and hypoxia. We found maximal proliferation and invasion when the multicellular spheroids were cultured in a tumor-aligned medium, having low pH and low glucose, with 10% fetal bovine serum under hypoxic conditions. In a 7-day assay, varying doses of fluorouracil or paclitaxel had differential effects on proliferation for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 tumor spheroids in microtumor compared to 2D and 3D monoculture. The microtumors exhibited a tumor morphology and drug response similar to published xenograft data, thus demonstrating a more physiologically predictive in vitro model.",
        "This paper studies how certain speculative transitions in financial markets can be ascribed to a symmetry break that happens in the collective decision making. Investors are assumed to be bounded rational, using a limited set of information including past price history and expectation on future dividends. Investment strategies are dynamically changed based on realized returns within a game theoretical scheme with Nash equilibria. In such a setting, markets behave as complex systems whose payoff reflect an intrinsic financial symmetry that guarantees equilibrium in price dynamics (fundamentalist state) until the symmetry is broken leading to bubble or anti-bubble scenarios (speculative state). We model such two-phase transition in a micro-to-macro scheme through a Ginzburg-Landau-based power expansion leading to a market temperature parameter which modulates the state transitions in the market. Via simulations we prove that transitions in the market price dynamics can be phenomenologically explained by the number of traders, the number of strategies and amount of information used by agents, all included in our market temperature parameter.",
        "Cysticidal drug treatment of viable Taenia solium brain parenchymal cysts leads to an acute pericystic host inflammatory response and blood brain barrier breakdown (BBB), commonly resulting in seizures. Naturally infected pigs, untreated or treated one time with praziquantel were sacrificed at 48 hr and 120 hr following the injection of Evans blue (EB) to assess the effect of treatment on larval parasites and surrounding tissue. Examination of harvested non encapsulated muscle cysts unexpectedly revealed one or more small, focal round region(s) of Evans blue dye infiltration (REBI) on the surface of otherwise non dye-stained muscle cysts. Histopathological analysis of REBI revealed focal areas of eosinophil-rich inflammatory infiltrates that migrated from the capsule into the tegument and internal structures of the parasite. In addition some encapsulated brain cysts, in which the presence of REBI could not be directly assessed, showed histopathology identical to that of the REBI. Muscle cysts with REBI were more frequent in pigs that had received praziquantel (6.6% of 3736 cysts; n = 6 pigs) than in those that were untreated (0.2% of 3172 cysts; n = 2 pigs). Similar results were found in the brain, where 20.7% of 29 cysts showed histopathology identical to muscle REBI cysts in praziquantel-treated pigs compared to the 4.3% of 47 cysts in untreated pigs. Closer examination of REBI infiltrates showed that EB was taken up only by eosinophils, a major component of the cellular infiltrates, which likely explains persistence of EB in the REBI. REBI likely represent early damaging host responses to T. solium cysts and highlight the focal nature of this initial host response and the importance of eosinophils at sites of host-parasite interaction. These findings suggest new avenues for immunomodulation to reduce inflammatory side effects of anthelmintic therapy.",
        "Improved understanding and quantification of social contact patterns that govern the transmission dynamics of respiratory viral infections has utility in the design of preventative and control measures such as vaccination and social distancing. The objective of this study was to quantify an age-specific matrix of contact rates for a predominantly rural low-income population that would support transmission dynamic modeling of respiratory viruses.From the population register of the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System, coastal Kenya, 150 individuals per age group (<1, 1-5, 6-15, 16-19, 20-49, 50 and above, in years) were selected by stratified random sampling and requested to complete a day long paper diary of physical contacts (e.g. touch or embrace). The sample was stratified by residence (rural-to-semiurban), month (August 2011 to January 2012, spanning seasonal changes in socio-cultural activities), and day of week. Usable diary responses were obtained from 568 individuals (∼50% of expected). The mean number of contacts per person per day was 17.7 (95% CI 16.7-18.7). Infants reported the lowest contact rates (mean 13.9, 95% CI 12.1-15.7), while primary school students (6-15 years) reported the highest (mean 20.1, 95% CI 18.0-22.2). Rates of contact were higher within groups of similar age (assortative), particularly within the primary school students and adults (20-49 years). Adults and older participants (>50 years) exhibited the highest inter-generational contacts. Rural contact rates were higher than semiurban (18.8 vs 15.6, p = 0.002), with rural primary school students having twice as many assortative contacts as their semiurban peers.This is the first age-specific contact matrix to be defined for tropical Sub-Saharan Africa and has utility in age-structured models to assess the potential impact of interventions for directly transmitted respiratory infections.",
        "The molecular determinants underpinning how hexaacylated lipid A and tetraacylated precursor lipid IVa activate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) are well understood, but how activation is induced by other lipid A species is less clear. Species specificity studies have clarified how TLR4/MD-2 recognises different lipid A structures, for example tetraacylated lipid IVa requires direct electrostatic interactions for agonism. In this study, we examine how pentaacylated lipopolysaccharide from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RSLPS) antagonises human TLR4/MD-2 and activates the horse receptor complex using a computational approach and cross-species mutagenesis. At a functional level, we show that RSLPS is a partial agonist at horse TLR4/MD-2 with greater efficacy than lipid IVa. These data suggest the importance of the additional acyl chain in RSLPS signalling. Based on docking analysis, we propose a model for positioning of the RSLPS lipid A moiety (RSLA) within the MD-2 cavity at the TLR4 dimer interface, which allows activity at the horse receptor complex. As for lipid IVa, RSLPS agonism requires species-specific contacts with MD-2 and TLR4, but the R2 chain of RSLA protrudes from the MD-2 pocket to contact the TLR4 dimer in the vicinity of proline 442. Our model explains why RSLPS is only partially dependent on horse TLR4 residue R385, unlike lipid IVa. Mutagenesis of proline 442 into a serine residue, as found in human TLR4, uncovers the importance of this site in RSLPS signalling; horse TLR4 R385G/P442S double mutation completely abolishes RSLPS activity without its counterpart, human TLR4 G384R/S441P, being able to restore it. Our data highlight the importance of subtle changes in ligand positioning, and suggest that TLR4 and MD-2 residues that may not participate directly in ligand binding can determine the signalling outcome of a given ligand. This indicates a cooperative binding mechanism within the receptor complex, which is becoming increasingly important in TLR signalling.",
        "In neonatal encephalopathy (NE), infectious co-morbidity is difficult to diagnose accurately, but may increase the vulnerability of the developing brain to hypoxia-ischemia. We developed a novel panel of species-specific real-time PCR assays to identify bloodstream pathogens amongst newborns with and without NE in Uganda.Multiplex real-time PCR assays for important neonatal bloodstream pathogens (gram positive and gram negative bacteria, cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus(HSV) and P. falciparum) were performed on whole blood taken from 202 encephalopathic and 101 control infants. Automated blood culture (BACTEC) was performed for all cases and unwell controls.Prevalence of pathogenic bacterial species amongst infants with NE was 3.6%, 6.9% and 8.9%, with culture, PCR and both tests in combination, respectively. More encephalopathic infants than controls had pathogenic bacterial species detected (8.9%vs2.0%, p = 0.028) using culture and PCR in combination. PCR detected bacteremia in 11 culture negative encephalopathic infants (3 Group B Streptococcus, 1 Group A Streptococcus, 1 Staphylococcus aureus and 6 Enterobacteriacae). Coagulase negative staphylococcus, frequently detected by PCR amongst case and control infants, was considered a contaminant. Prevalence of CMV, HSV and malaria amongst cases was low (1.5%, 0.5% and 0.5%, respectively).This real-time PCR panel detected more bacteremia than culture alone and provides a novel tool for detection of neonatal bloodstream pathogens that may be applied across a range of clinical situations and settings. Significantly more encephalopathic infants than controls had pathogenic bacterial species detected suggesting that infection may be an important risk factor for NE in this setting.",
        "Phonological awareness, letter knowledge, oral language (including sentence recall) and rapid automatised naming are acknowledged within-child predictors of literacy development. Separate research has identified family factors including socio-economic status, parents' level of education and family history. However, both approaches have left unexplained significant amounts of variance in literacy outcomes. This longitudinal study sought to improve prospective classification accuracy for young children at risk of literacy failure by adding two new family measures (parents' phonological awareness and parents' perceived self-efficacy), and then combining the within-child and family factors.Pre-literacy skills were measured in 102 four year olds (46 girls and 56 boys) at the beginning of Preschool, and then at the beginning and end of Kindergarten, when rapid automatised naming was also measured. Family factors data were collected at the beginning of Preschool, and children's literacy outcomes were measured at the end of Year 1 (age 6-7 years).Children from high-risk backgrounds showed poorer literacy outcomes than low-risk students, though three family factors (school socio-economic status, parents' phonological awareness, and family history) typically accounted for less Year 1 variance than the within-child factors. Combining these family factors with the end of Kindergarten within-child factors provided the most accurate classification (i.e., sensitivity = .85; specificity = .90; overall correct = .88).Our approach would identify at-risk children for intervention before they began to fail. Moreover, it would be cost-effective because although few at-risk children would be missed, allocation of unnecessary educational resources would be minimised.",
        "The JmjC domain-containing protein JMJD3/KDM6B catalyses the demethylation of H3K27me3 and H3K27me2. JMJD3 appears to be highly regulated at the transcriptional level and is upregulated in response to diverse stimuli such as differentiation inducers and stress signals. Accordingly, JMJD3 has been linked to the regulation of different biological processes such as differentiation of embryonic stem cells, inflammatory responses in macrophages, and induction of cellular senescence via regulation of the INK4A-ARF locus. Here we show here that JMJD3 interacts with the tumour suppressor protein p53. We find that the interaction is dependent on the p53 tetramerization domain. Following DNA damage, JMJD3 is transcriptionally upregulated and by performing genome-wide mapping of JMJD3, we demonstrate that it binds genes involved in basic cellular processes, as well as genes regulating cell cycle, response to stress and apoptosis. Moreover, we find that JMJD3 binding sites show significant overlap with p53 bound promoters and enhancer elements. The binding of JMJD3 to p53 target sites is increased in response to DNA damage, and we demonstrate that the recruitment of JMJD3 to these sites is dependent on p53 expression. Therefore, we propose a model in which JMJD3 is recruited to p53 responsive elements via its interaction with p53 and speculate that JMJD3 could act as a fail-safe mechanism to remove low levels of H3K27me3 and H3K27me2 to allow for efficient acetylation of H3K27.",
        "The orthodox role of the invariant chain (CD74; Ii) is in antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells, but enhanced CD8+ T cells responses have been reported after vaccination with vectored viral vaccines encoding a fusion of Ii to the antigen of interest. In this study we assessed whether fusion of the malarial antigen, ME-TRAP, to Ii could increase the vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell response. Following single or heterologous prime-boost vaccination of mice with a recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus vector, ChAd63, or recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), higher frequencies of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were observed, with the largest increases observed following a ChAd63-MVA heterologous prime-boost regimen. Studies in non-human primates confirmed the ability of Ii-fusion to augment the T cell response, where a 4-fold increase was maintained up to 11 weeks after the MVA boost. Of the numerous different approaches explored to increase vectored vaccine induced immunogenicity over the years, fusion to the invariant chain showed a consistent enhancement in CD8+ T cell responses across different animal species and may therefore find application in the development of vaccines against human malaria and other diseases where high levels of cell-mediated immunity are required.",
        "Nucleic acid testing (NAT) for malaria parasites is an increasingly recommended diagnostic endpoint in clinical trials of vaccine and drug candidates and is also important in surveillance of malaria control and elimination efforts. A variety of reported NAT assays have been described, yet no formal external quality assurance (EQA) program provides validation for the assays in use. Here, we report results of an EQA exercise for malaria NAT assays. Among five centers conducting controlled human malaria infection trials, all centers achieved 100% specificity and demonstrated limits of detection consistent with each laboratory's pre-stated expectations. Quantitative bias of reported results compared to expected results was generally <0.5 log10 parasites/mL except for one laboratory where the EQA effort identified likely reasons for a general quantitative shift. The within-laboratory variation for all assays was low at <10% coefficient of variation across a range of parasite densities. Based on this study, we propose to create a Molecular Malaria Quality Assessment program that fulfills the need for EQA of malaria NAT assays worldwide.",
        "Febrile illnesses are pre-eminent contributors to morbidity and mortality among children in South-East Asia but the causes are poorly understood. We determined the causes of fever in children hospitalised in Siem Reap province, Cambodia.A one-year prospective study of febrile children admitted to Angkor Hospital for Children, Siem Reap. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and outcome data were comprehensively analysed. Between October 12(th) 2009 and October 12(th) 2010 there were 1225 episodes of febrile illness in 1180 children. Median (IQR) age was 2.0 (0.8-6.4) years, with 850 (69%) episodes in children <5 years. Common microbiological diagnoses were dengue virus (16.2%), scrub typhus (7.8%), and Japanese encephalitis virus (5.8%). 76 (6.3%) episodes had culture-proven bloodstream infection, including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (22 isolates, 1.8%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (13, 1.1%), Escherichia coli (8, 0.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (7, 0.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (6, 0.5%) and Burkholderia pseudomallei (6, 0.5%). There were 69 deaths (5.6%), including those due to clinically diagnosed pneumonia (19), dengue virus (5), and melioidosis (4). 10 of 69 (14.5%) deaths were associated with culture-proven bloodstream infection in logistic regression analyses (odds ratio for mortality 3.4, 95% CI 1.6-6.9). Antimicrobial resistance was prevalent, particularly in S. enterica Typhi, (where 90% of isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, and 86% were multi-drug resistant). Comorbid undernutrition was present in 44% of episodes and a major risk factor for acute mortality (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.2), as were HIV infection and cardiac disease.We identified a microbiological cause of fever in almost 50% of episodes in this large study of community-acquired febrile illness in hospitalized children in Cambodia. The range of pathogens, antimicrobial susceptibility, and co-morbidities associated with mortality described will be of use in the development of rational guidelines for infectious disease treatment and control in Cambodia and South-East Asia.",
        "Early warning scores (EWS) are widely used in well-resourced healthcare settings to identify patients at risk of mortality. The Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) is a well-known EWS used comprehensively in the United Kingdom. The HOTEL score (Hypotension, Oxygen saturation, Temperature, ECG abnormality, Loss of independence) was developed and tested in a European cohort; however, its validity is unknown in resource limited settings. This study compared the performance of both scores and suggested modifications to enhance accuracy.A prospective cohort study of adults (≥18 yrs) admitted to medical wards at a Malawian hospital. Primary outcome was mortality within three days. Performance of MEWS and HOTEL were assessed using ROC analysis. Logistic regression analysis identified important predictors of mortality and from this a new score was defined.Three-hundred-and-two patients were included. Fifty-one (16.9%) died within three days of admission. With a cut-point ≥2, the HOTEL score had sensitivity 70.6% (95% CI: 56.2 to 82.5) and specificity 59.4% (95% CI: 53.0 to 65.5), and was superior to MEWS (cut-point ≥5); sensitivity: 58.8% (95% CI: 44.2 to 72.4), specificity: 56.2% (95% CI: 49.8 to 62.4). The new score, dubbed TOTAL (Tachypnoea, Oxygen saturation, Temperature, Alert, Loss of independence), showed slight improvement with a cut-point ≥2; sensitivity 76.5% (95% CI: 62.5 to 87.2) and specificity 67.3% (95% CI: 61.1 to 73.1).Using an EWS generated in developed healthcare systems in resource limited settings results in loss of sensitivity and specificity. A score based on predictors of mortality specific to the Malawian population showed enhanced accuracy but not enough to warrant clinical use. Despite an assumption of common physiological responses, disease and population differences seem to strongly determine the performance of EWS. Local validation and impact assessment of these scores should precede their adoption in resource limited settings.",
        "Pim-1 kinase, a serine/threonine protein kinase encoded by the pim proto-oncogene, is involved in several signalling pathways such as the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Many cancer types show high expression levels of Pim kinases and particularly Pim-1 has been linked to the initiation and progression of the malignant phenotype. In several cancer tissues somatic Pim-1 mutants have been identified. These natural variants are nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, variations of a single nucleotide occurring in the coding region and leading to amino acid substitutions. In this study we investigated the effect of amino acid substitution on the structural stability and on the activity of Pim-1 kinase. We expressed and purified some of the mutants of Pim-1 kinase that are expressed in cancer tissues and reported in the single nucleotide polymorphisms database. The point mutations in the variants significantly affect the conformation of the native state of Pim-1. All the mutants, expressed as soluble recombinant proteins, show a decreased thermal and thermodynamic stability and a lower activation energy values for kinase activity. The decreased stability accompanied by an increased flexibility suggests that Pim-1 variants may be involved in a wider network of protein interactions. All mutants bound ATP and ATP mimetic inhibitors with comparable IC50 values suggesting that the studied Pim-1 kinase mutants can be efficiently targeted with inhibitors developed for the wild type protein.",
        "The prevalence of obesity and associated health conditions is increasing in the developed world. Obesity is related to atrophy and dysfunction of the hippocampus and hippocampal lesions may lead to increased appetite and weight gain. The hippocampus is connected via the fornix tract to the hypothalamus, orbitofrontal cortex, and the nucleus accumbens, all key structures for homeostatic and reward related control of food intake. The present study employed diffusion MRI tractography to investigate the relationship between microstructural properties of the fornix and variation in Body Mass Index (BMI), within normal and overweight ranges, in a group of community-dwelling older adults (53-93 years old). Larger BMI was associated with larger axial and mean diffusivity in the fornix (r = 0.64 and r = 0.55 respectively), relationships that were most pronounced in overweight individuals. Moreover, controlling for age, education, cognitive performance, blood pressure and global brain volume increased these correlations. Similar associations were not found in the parahippocampal cingulum, a comparison temporal association pathway. Thus, microstructural changes in fornix white matter were observed in older adults with increasing BMI levels from within normal to overweight ranges, so are not exclusively related to obesity. We propose that hippocampal-hypothalamic-prefrontal interactions, mediated by the fornix, contribute to the healthy functioning of networks involved in food intake control. The fornix, in turn, may display alterations in microstructure that reflect weight gain.",
        "We employed a random mutagenesis approach to identify novel monogenic determinants of type 2 diabetes. Here we show that haplo-insufficiency of the histone methyltransferase myeloid-lineage leukemia (Mll2/Wbp7) gene causes type 2 diabetes in the mouse. We have shown that mice heterozygous for two separate mutations in the SET domain of Mll2 or heterozygous Mll2 knockout mice were hyperglycaemic, hyperinsulinaemic and developed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Consistent with previous Mll2 knockout studies, mice homozygous for either ENU mutation (or compound heterozygotes) died during embryonic development at 9.5-14.5 days post coitum. Heterozygous deletion of Mll2 induced in the adult mouse results in a normal phenotype suggesting that changes in chromatin methylation during development result in the adult phenotype. Mll2 has been shown to regulate a small subset of genes, a number of which Neurod1, Enpp1, Slc27a2, and Plcxd1 are downregulated in adult mutant mice. Our results demonstrate that histone H3K4 methyltransferase Mll2 is a component of the genetic regulation necessary for glucose homeostasis, resulting in a specific disease pattern linking chromatin modification with causes and progression of type 2 diabetes, providing a basis for its further understanding at the molecular level.",
        "A-type lamins encoded by LMNA form a structural fibrillar meshwork within the mammalian nucleus. How this nuclear organization may influence the execution of biological processes involving DNA transactions remains unclear. Here, we characterize changes in the dynamics and biochemical interactions of lamin A/C after DNA damage. We find that DNA breakage reduces the mobility of nucleoplasmic GFP-lamin A throughout the nucleus as measured by dynamic fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy in living cells, suggestive of incorporation into stable macromolecular complexes, but does not induce the focal accumulation of GFP-lamin A at damage sites. Using a proximity ligation assay and biochemical analyses, we show that lamin A engages chromatin via histone H2AX and its phosphorylated form (γH2AX) induced by DNA damage, and that these interactions are enhanced after DNA damage. Finally, we use three-dimensional time-lapse imaging to show that LMNA inactivation significantly reduces the positional stability of DNA repair foci in living cells. This defect is partially rescued by the stable expression of GFP-lamin A. Thus collectively, our findings suggest that the dynamic structural meshwork formed by A-type lamins anchors sites of DNA repair in mammalian nuclei, providing fresh insight into the control of DNA transactions by nuclear structural organization.",
        "CALM (clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein) is a cargo-selective adaptor for the post-Golgi R-SNAREs VAMPs 2, 3, and 8, and it also regulates the size of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles at the plasma membrane. The present study has two objectives: to determine whether CALM can sort additional VAMPs, and to investigate whether VAMP sorting contributes to CALM-dependent vesicle size regulation. Using a flow cytometry-based endocytosis efficiency assay, we demonstrate that CALM is also able to sort VAMPs 4 and 7, even though they have sorting signals for other clathrin adaptors. CALM homologues are present in nearly every eukaryote, suggesting that the CALM family may have evolved as adaptors for retrieving all post-Golgi VAMPs from the plasma membrane. Using a knockdown/rescue system, we show that wild-type CALM restores normal VAMP sorting in CALM-depleted cells, but that two non-VAMP-binding mutants do not. However, when we assayed the effect of CALM depletion on coated pit morphology, using a fluorescence microscopy-based assay, we found that the two mutants were as effective as wild-type CALM. Thus, we can uncouple the sorting function of CALM from its structural role.",
        "Keratin 7 (K7) is a Type II member of the keratin superfamily and despite its widespread expression in different types of simple and transitional epithelia, its functional role in vivo remains elusive, in part due to the lack of any appropriate mouse models or any human diseases that are associated with KRT7 gene mutations. Using conventional gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells, we report here the generation and characterisation of the first K7 knockout mouse. Loss of K7 led to increased proliferation of the bladder urothelium although this was not associated with hyperplasia. K18, a presumptive type I assembly partner for K7, showed reduced expression in the bladder whereas K20, a marker of the terminally differentiated superficial urothelial cells was transcriptionally up-regulated. No other epithelia were seen to be adversely affected by the loss of K7 and western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy analysis revealed that the expression of K8, K18, K19 and K20 were not altered in the absence of K7, with the exception of the kidney where there was reduced K18 expression.",
        "Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is an important cause of inherited mitochondrial blindness among young adults. The majority of patients carry one of three mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) point mutations: m.3460G>A, m.11778G>A and m.14484T>C, all of which affect critical complex I subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. LHON is characterised by marked incomplete penetrance, clearly implying that the mtDNA mutation is insufficient on its own to trigger retinal ganglion cell dysfunction and visual loss. In this case series of three affected patients harbouring the m.11778G>A mutation, we provide evidence suggesting that raised intraocular pressure could be a risk factor triggering visual loss in at-risk LHON carriers.",
        "This Research Paper by Dr. Alex P. Schmid opens with a brief exposition of the foreign (terrorist) fighter (FTF) phenomenon, concentrating on Salafist jihadists and their astonishing growth after the Caliphate was proclaimed in mid-2014. The author then discusses various definitions of FTFs. Subsequently, Dr. Schmid seeks to bring structure and order into the widely diverging estimates of the numbers of foreign fighters. He then identifies problems posed by foreign fighters for European democracies with Muslim diasporas, focusing on the range of motivations driving vulnerable young men and women – mainly second generation immigrants and recent converts to Islam – to join the so-called “Islamic State”. Having identified push and pull as well as resilience factors that facilitate or inhibit young Muslims joining ISIS, he argues that stopping them from departing to Syria is not enough; political solutions have to be sought. The principal compiler of the bibliography is Dr. Judith Tinnes. An earlier version of the first part of this Research Report has been published as an ICCT Policy Brief in October 2015.",
        "The media products of the revolutionary movement known as the Islamic State (also IS, ISIL, ISIS, Daesh) have received a significant amount of attention from analysts and journalists alike. While extremely helpful, most of this effort is focused at performing content analysis of fairly recent products. As part of the Counter-Terrorism Strategic Communication (CTSC) project’s effort to better understand propaganda messaging in the 21st century, the author of this Research Paper examined primary documents and other media published by the Islamic State movement during its entire existence in order to develop a history of the media department since 2003. The framework for analysis focused on the interaction between key media leaders, the ever-expanding structure and institutions, and the process of innovation used to experiment with different media techniques in different phases of the group’s evolution. Based on this history, the paper presents six observations about the media department and its role in the larger movement – in the hopes that this knowledge will be helpful in efforts to combat this particular group and its inevitable imitators in the future.",
        "France ranks first in the EU as a provider of foreign terrorist fighters in Syria and Iraq, and as the most-targeted European country in the context of the Syrian-Iraqi conflict. France has a longstanding history related to jihadism, correlated with multiple grievances from jihadist groups: it has been depicted as an enemy of Islam because of its foreign policy, its domestic policy towards religion, and, last but not least, its very essence. These grievances have been conveyed, like the baton of a relay race, from the first generations of North-African Islamist networks and the “elder brothers of jihad” to contemporary jihadists. The French jihadist media ecosystem has been instrumental in attracting a particularly large contemporary following. From the French perspective, a range of social, cultural, religious, economic, political, demographic drivers and identity factors converged to create a fertile ground for receptive radicals to emerge and break away from democratic values. Informed by these issues, this Policy Brief aims to identify avenues of further development for the French counter-terrorism strategic communication strategy. It concludes by stressing the need for this communication strategy to strive for positive, alternative messaging to re-create a continuum between individuals in the jihadist milieu and France as a nation state.",
        "In this Research Paper, Former Visiting Fellow Akinola Olojo examines the key drivers of public support for Boko Haram in northern Nigeria. The author suggests that the effective formulation and implementation of a proactive (Nigerian) counter-terrorism strategy requires an incisive understanding of the political, socio-economic and religious/ideological drivers of public support for the group. The multi-dimensional nature of the Boko Haram crisis in northern Nigeria challenges conventional approaches used in addressing terrorist violence. Olojo reflects on the need for a bold mix of interventions and partnerships that combine elements of both hard and soft power. The application of these approaches by both domestic actors and external partners must necessarily draw upon an understanding of the key drivers that this Paper explores.",
        "With the outbreak of civil war and sectarian violence in Syria, Iraq, and Libya, over 15,000 men and women from more than 80 countries around the world have left their homes to become foreign fighters. The security challenge they pose is immense and there are concerns about radicalised fighters returning to their countries of origin or residence, hardened by experience and with the possible intent – and the know-how – to engage in terrorist activities.\r\n\r\nOn 24 September, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2178 (2014) with the support of over 120 states representing a broad cross-section of the UN membership. Resolution 2178 called on all UN member states to ensure increased border security and to screen for or arrest so-called “foreign terrorist fighters” (FTFs) travelling to or returning from conflict areas. Rightly so, it also urges states to counter violent extremism by taking preventive measures, such as engaging with communities at the local level to stop the spread of extremist ideologies.\r\n\r\nOn 23 October 2014, the Global Center on Cooperative Security, the Human Security Collective, and ICCT convened an expert meeting at the European Union (EU) in Brussels to discuss the implications of the resolution and to explore appropriate and effective responses to the threat of FTFs, both within the EU and as part of the Union’s foreign security and development programming.\r\n\r\nBuilding upon the discussion in Brussels, this policy brief is a compilation of essays from all three organisations on the challenges and opportunities for addressing the FTF threat from a European Union perspective. It also examines the implementation of Resolution 2178 as an integral part of national and multilateral foreign security and development policies and initiatives.",
        "In March 2012, Prof. Dr. Rohan Gunaratna interviewed Umar Patek and Ali Imron, both of whom have admitted involvement in the two bomb attacks in Bali in October 2002 which killed over 200 people. This ICCT Research Paper explores violent extremist “narratives” within the Indonesian context by interviewing a convicted terrorist (Ali Imron) and one currently undergoing trial (Umar Patek). It is hoped that by understanding and de-constructing those emotional stories or ideologies that are often told and used to justify violence, or to motivate someone to commit violence, in pursuit of a cause; that the policy making community can then counter these narratives more effectively. This Paper first explores the background of violent extremist narratives and then recounts and analyses the Patek and Imron interviews. Based on these interviews and current knowledge of violent extremist narratives, the paper concludes with a series of recommendations.",
        "Since 9/11, the state of the art in counter-terrorism research, counter-terorism measures and counter-terrorism impacts has taken off. Nevertheless, countering terrorism as a branch of fear management is still a discipline to be developed. In this Research Paper, authors Prof. Dr. Edwin Bakker and Prof. Dr. Beatrice de Graaf attempt to lessen this gap. The Paper identifies and analyses governmental approaches to managing fear in relation to terrorist incidents. It is a stocktaking approach, offering a preliminary oversight of some central aspects and pointers on the way forward when constructing and testing such a theory.",

        "This Policy Brief – a short version of a larger Research Paper to be released by ICCT in late 2015 – focuses on the phenomenon of foreign (terrorist) fighters (FTFs) as it relates to Syria and Iraq. It concentrates on recruits to jihad and the astonishing growth in numbers from less than 1,000 in 2011 to more than 3,500 in 2012, 8,500+ in 2013, 18,000+ in 2014 to more than 25,000 by fall 2015. By October 2015, nearly 30,000 militants from more than 100 countries had become foreign fighters with the so-called “Islamic State” (IS) in Syria and Iraq and other militant groups. This Policy Brief first discusses various definitions of FTFs by disaggregating the “foreign”, “terrorist” and “fighters” elements of FTFs of the UN Security Council definition in resolution 2178 (2014). Subsequently, an attempt is made to bring some structure and order to the widely diverging estimates of the numbers of foreign fighters and their origins, with tables presenting the best available estimates for different sides of the conflict at different moments in time since 2011. UN estimates on foreign fighters are juxtaposed with estimates from other sources. The biggest uncertainty is the ratio of foreign fighters to IS own core manpower. It is likely that at least 40 percent of the fighters of IS are foreigners and many more if Iraqis in Syria are counted as such.",
        "Converts to Islam represent a small percentage of the Muslim community in Western countries. Yet when it comes to Islamist extremism and terrorism, research has suggested that converts are considerably overrepresented. This ICCT Policy Brief serves as an introduction to this topic by providing an overview of what is known about converts’ involvement in homegrown jihadism and the foreign fighter phenomenon. Notwithstanding considerable reservations about the quantity and quality of the available data, this Policy Brief finds support for the notion of convert overrepresentation in these activities. This is especially so in the case of foreign fighters. What little data was found on converts’ involvement in homegrown jihadism provided a more nuanced picture, emphasizing that overrepresentation may not be the norm in all Western countries and that it may be a relatively recent development. Numerous explanations for converts’ involvement in Islamist extremism and terrorism have been provided, running the gamut from structural-level explanations to distinctly personal motives. At present, however, a comprehensive, theoretically sound and empirically grounded understanding of how and why converts become involved in Islamist militancy is absent. The Policy Brief concludes by stressing the need to develop our understanding of this important yet under-researched topic.",
        "Research on the engagement of children with the so-called Islamic State (a.k.a. ISIS) relies heavily on the analysis of obtained ISIS documents and ISIS-disseminated propaganda, leaving major elements of the recruitment and deployment process uncovered. Such ambiguities hinder future efforts aimed at dealing with ISIS’ child soldiers. As such, an intensive effort to compile data using interviews and naturalistic observations across ISIS-held territories in Syria was made to exhaustively explore the process of child recruitment and deployment by ISIS. Findings suggest that there are two methods of recruitment: predatory and structural. The enlistment, intensity of indoctrination, types of training, and nature of deployment were found to depend, to a high degree, on the type of recruitment (i.e., predatory or structural), and category of children based on their origin (i.e., local, Middle Eastern and North African [MENA], or foreign) and if they are orphans. The data shows that the separation between children and adults’ roles/assignments is diminishing. After a thorough exploration of the elements of ISIS’ recruitment and deployment process, this paper argues its findings, implications, and limitations.",

The outcomes of the Expert Meeting on this topic, that took place on 22 March 2011, have been incorporated in this paper.",
        "In this Research Paper, Research Fellow Dr. Alex P. Schmid seeks to clarify some conceptual issues that tend to obscure the debate about how best to counter violent extremism. The main focus of this Research Paper is on obtaining a clearer understanding of what “Islamist extremism” entails in the context of the ongoing debate on allegedly “acceptable” non-violent extremists and “unacceptable” violent extremists. The author discusses a number of conceptualisations of religious extremism in the context of liberal democracies and also distinguishes, inter alia, between merely “not (yet) violent” militancy and principled non-violent political activism in the Gandhian tradition. The author argues that the distinction between “non-violent extremism” and “violent extremism” is not a valid one. The paper provides a set of twenty indicators of extremism that can be used as an instrument for monitoring extremist statements and actions, with an eye to challenging and countering such non-democratic manifestations.",
        "The number of European foreign fighters with a jihadist political agenda participating in the Syrian civil war has increased exponentially over the past months and has become an ever-growing concern for European policymakers. It is particularly the possibility that returned foreign fighters have radicalised that makes them a potential threat – if only to themselves and their direct surroundings. In this Research Paper, Edwin Bakker, Christophe Paulussen and Eva Entenmann examine some of the challenges, as well as possible strategies and legal mechanisms available for European policymakers to address the foreign fighters phenomenon. It first assesses the complex threat (potentially) posed by returning mujahidin to Europe’s security. The Research Paper then outlines some of the risk assessment and governance challenges that European policymakers, governments and legal practitioners face in relation to (potential) foreign jihadi fighters and returnees. Prosecution via international crimes will be analysed before turning to specific national practices. Here, the Research Paper focuses on a few European states that have a considerable number of departing foreign fighters as estimated by their own intelligence services: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and the UK. The Research Paper concludes with a series of recommendations.",
        "This Research Paper aims to analyse in depth the global propaganda strategy of the so-called “Islamic State” (IS) by looking at the methods through which this grand strategy is carried out as well as the objectives that IS wants to achieve through it. The authors first discuss IS’ growth model, explaining why global expansion and recruitment of foreign fighters are pivotal to IS success. Having in mind this critical role, the authors then explore the narratives and themes used by the group to mobilise foreign fighters and jihadists groups. Third, the paper analyses how IS deploys its narratives in those territories where it has established a foothold. Fourth, it outlines IS’ direct engagement strategy and how it is used to facilitate allegiance of other jihadist groups. The final section of the paper offers a menu of policy options that stakeholders can implement to counter IS’ global propaganda efforts.",
        "The thermo-mechanical attributes of DMR-249A steel weld joints manufactured by shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) and activated gas tungsten arc welding (A-GTAW) processes were studied using Finite Element Model (FEM) simulation. The thermal gradients and residual stresses were analyzed with SYSWELD software using double ellipsoidal heat source distribution model. The numerically estimated temperature distribution was validated with online temperature measurements using thermocouples. The predicted residual stresses profile across the weld joints was compared with the values experimentally measured using non-destructive techniques. The measured and predicted thermal cycles and residual stress profile was observed to be comparable. The residual stress developed in double sided A-GTAW joint were marginally higher in comparison to five pass SMAW joint due to phase transformation associated with high heat input per weld pass for A-GTAW process. The present investigations suggest the applicability of numerical modeling as an effective approach for predicting the thermo-mechanical properties influenced by welding techniques for DMR-249A steel weld joints. The tensile, impact and micro-hardness tests were carried to compare the welds. Considering benefits of high productivity and savings of labor and cost associated with A-GTAW compared to SMAW process, the minor variation in residual stress build up of A-GTAW joint can be neglected to develop A-GTAW as qualified alternative welding technique for DMR-249A steel.",
        "Cocrystallization is a promising technique for the design and preparation of new explosives, and the stability of cocrystal is highly concerned by the researchers. In order to make a better understanding of the behavior of cocrystal under the extreme conditions, DFT (density functional theory) calculation is performed to investigate the effect of hydrostatic pressure on geometrical and electronic structures of the cocrystal BTF (benzotrifuroxan)/TNA (2,4,6-trinitroaniline). When the hydrostatic pressure is applied, the lattice constants, volume, density and total energy change gradually except at the pressures of 40 GPa and 79–83 GPa. It is noteworthy that new chemical bonds form when the pressure is up to 83 GPa. The band gap of the cocrystal becomes smaller when the pressure is applied, and finally the cocrystal shows a characteristic of metal. The mechanical property of cocrystal is calculated by MD (molecular dynamics) simulation. The results show that the cocrystal has a better ductibility at low temperature, and has the best tenacity at 295 K.",
        "A new guidance law, called biased retro proportional navigation (BRPN), is proposed. The guidance law is designed to intercept high-speed targets with angular constraint, which can be used for ballistic target interception. BRPN guidance law is defined, and the exact time-varying bias for a required impact angle is derived. Furthermore, the simulation results (trajectory, variation of navigation ratio, capture region, etc) are compared with those of biased proportional navigation (BPN), proportional navigation and retro-proportional navigation. The results show that, at the cost of a higher intercept time, BRPN demands lower terminal lateral acceleration and has larger capture region compared to BPN.",

        "Computations by density functional theory (DFT) method are performed on a series of di-1H-1,3,4-triazole derivatives with different substituents and linkages. The heat of formation (HOF) is predicted by the designed isodesmic reactions. The predicted results reveal that –N3 and –NN– groups are effective structural units for increasing the HOF values of the di-1H-1,3,4-triazole derivatives. The HOMO–LUMO gap is affected by the substituents and linkage groups. Detonation performance is evaluated using the Kamlet–Jacobs approach based on the calculated density and HOF. The results indicate that –NO2, –NF2, –NH–, –NH–NH– and –NN– groups are helpful for enhancing the detonation properties of di-1H-1,3,4-triazole derivatives. The bond dissociation energy and bond order of the weakest bonds are analyzed to investigate their stability. It is observed that the –CH2–, –CH2–CH2– and –CHCH– groups are effective structural units for improving the stabilities of these derivatives. Considering the detonation performance and the stability, five compounds are screened as the potential candidates for high energy density materials.",
        "A 30 mm electrothermal-chemical (ETC) gun experimental system is employed to research the burning rate characteristics of 4/7 high-nitrogen solid propellant. Enhanced gas generation rates (EGGR) of propellants during and after electrical discharges are verified in the experiments. A modified 0D internal ballistic model is established to simulate the ETC launch. According to the measured pressure and electrical parameters, a transient burning rate law including the influence of EGGR coefficient by electric power and pressure gradient (dp/dt) is added into the model. The EGGR coefficient of 4/7 high-nitrogen solid propellant is equal to 0.005 MW−1. Both simulated breech pressure and projectile muzzle velocity accord with the experimental results well. Compared with Woodley's modified burning rate law, the breech pressure curves acquired by the transient burning rate law are more consistent with test results. Based on the parameters calculated in the model, the relationship among propellant burning rate, pressure gradient (dp/dt) and electric power is analyzed. Depending on the transient burning rate law and experimental data, the burning of solid propellant under the condition of plasma is described more accurately.",
        "The production of colored flames is the primary purpose of military signaling, projectile tracing, and illuminating devices. Certain elements and compounds when heated to high temperature have the unique property of emitting lines or narrow bands in the visible region (380–780 nm). This study, reports on the development of novel yellow colored flame compositions with enhanced spectral performance in terms of luminous intensity, and color quality to standard Russian yellow tracer. The light intensity and the imprint spectra of developed yellow flares were measured using digital luxmeter and UV–Vis. spectrometer respectively. The main giving of this study is that the light intensity, and color quality of Russian yellow tracer were improved by 287%, and 170% respectively. This was accomplished by means of optimizing the ratio of novel binder to color source using aluminum metal fuel. Aluminum-based formulations were found to maximize the formation of yellow reactive emitting specimens, and to eliminate any interfering incandescent emission resulted from MgO. Quantification of yellow color emitting specimens in the combustion gaseous products was achieved using chemical equilibrium thermodynamic code named ICT (Institute of Chemical Technology in Germany, Virgin 2008); in an attempt to judge the light quality. This improvement in yellow flare performance established the rule that the emission intensity increases as the reaction temperature increases. In the meantime upper limit of temperature was avoided to maximize the color quality.",
        "In order to explore the rules of the deformation force during the launching of a small-diameter steel cartridge, the semi-closed bomb test method is used to test the greatest strains on chamber outer wall under the different chamber pressures. The pressure curves of cartridge chamber are measured in experiment, and the tensile test data of cartridge are loaded into the numerical calculation to compare with the experimental data. The conclusion was obtained that the calculated results match better with the experimental results by considering strain rate bilinear kinematic hardening material constitutive model. The forces on the various parts of the cartridge during launching and their deformation rules are achieved, in which the equivalent plastic strain decreases and the cylinder ring withstands the maximum equivalent stress when the cartridge case clings to the bore from the mouth to the bottom.",
        "The purpose of this study is to investigate and quantify some possible sources of dispersion of 120 mm APFSDS tank ammunition both experimentally and numerically. This paper aims to point out the most influential source during In-Bore Balloting Motion phase as well as in External Ballistics phase of the ammunition and quantifies its effect on dispersion. Data obtained from flight trials is critically analysed and parameters affecting dispersion such as initial yaw/pitch rates, yaw/pitch dampening, plane start angle, launch spin, clearance, centre of gravity shift, dynamic imbalance angle, cross wind, etc. are observed and, later on, studied in detail by extensive External Ballistics Monte Carlo (EBMC) simulation and Six Degree of Freedom (6-DOF) trajectory analysis.\nIn Bore Balloting Motion simulation shows that reduction in residual spin by about 5% results in drastic 56% reduction in first maximum yaw. A correlation between first maximum yaw and residual spin is observed. Results of data analysis are used in design modification for existing ammunition. Number of designs are evaluated numerically before freezing five designs for further soundings. These designs are critically assessed in terms of their comparative performance during In-bore travel & external ballistics phase. Results are validated by free flight trials for the finalised design.",
        "Buried high explosive (HE) charges represent a high threat to military vehicles. The detonation of these charges can lead to significant momentum transfer onto vehicles and their occupants. A detailed understanding of the physical processes involved in the loading of vehicle structures is necessary for an optimization of effective countermeasures and protection systems. A quantitative description of the local momentum distribution on the vehicle underbody due to the detonation process is of special importance. In the following, a new test setup is presented that allows the experimental determination of the specific impulse distribution. It is based on a ring arrangement where the elements are nested into each other and the velocity of each ring is correlated with the local specific impulse at its position.\nThe momentum transfer to a vehicle depends on a number of influencing factors such as: charge mass, embedding material (e.g. sand, gravel, clay), density, water content, saturation, depth of burial, ground clearance and vehicle shape. The presented technology is applied to quantify the influence of the embedding material (alluvial sand, quartz sand), the burial depth and the water content on the local specific impulse distribution. The obtained data can be used as initial condition for the numerical simulation of occupant safety assessment and as input for empirical modeling of momentum transfer on structures.",

The influences of various factors (conductivity, the gap between the sample surface and the sensor, the thickness of the sample) on the obtained hodographs are examined by taking the aluminum alloys for example, and the possibility of separation of various factors is analyzed. The results obtained are indicative of how much promise the proposed method offers for the inspection and testing of products made of aluminum alloys.",
        "Surface modification is essential for improving the service properties of components. Cladding is one of the most widely employed methods of surface modification. Friction surfacing is a candidate process for depositing the corrosion resistant coatings. Being a solid state process, it offers several advantages over conventional fusion based surfacing process. The aim of this work is to identify the relationship between the input variables and the process response and develop the predictive models that can be used in the design of new friction surfacing applications. In the current work, austenitic stainless steel AISI 304 was friction surfaced on high strength low alloy steel substrate. Friction surfacing parameters, such as mechtrode rotational speed, feed rate of substrate and axial force on mechtrode, play a major role in determining the pitting corrosion resistance and bond strength of friction surfaced coatings. Friction surfaced coating and base metal were tested for pitting corrosion by potentio-dynamic polarization technique. Coating microstructure was characterized using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Coatings in the as deposited condition exhibited strain-induced martensite in austenitic matrix. Pitting resistance of surfaced coatings was found to be much lower than that of mechtrode material and superior to that of substrate. A central composite design with three factors (mechtrode rotational speed, substrate traverse speed, axial load on mechtrode) and five levels was chosen to minimize the number of experimental conditions. Response surface methodology was used to develop the model. In the present work, an attempt has been made to develop a mathematical model to predict the pitting corrosion resistance and bond strength by incorporating the friction surfacing process parameters.",
        "An optimization method is introduced to design the aerodynamic parameters of a dual-spin two-dimensional guided projectile with the canards for trajectory correction. The nose guidance component contains two pairs of canards which can provide lift and despin with the projectile for stability. The optimal design algorithm is developed to decide the profiles both of the steering and spinning canards, and their deflection angles are also simulated to meet the needs of trajectory correction capabilities. Finally, the aerodynamic efficiency of the specific canards is discussed according to the CFD simulations. Results that obtained here can be further applied to the exterior ballistics design.",
        "The rails of electromagnetic railgun can be ablated by the temperature rise due to current concentration. The current distributions on the rails and armature are not only affected by the skin effect, but also influenced by the proximity effect which is rarely mentioned. This paper illustrated the difference between skin effect and proximity effect, and the influencing factors of proximity effect were investigated. Results show that the current is concentrated on the surface around rails due to the skin effect, and the proximity effect exacerbates the current density on the inner surfaces of rails. Decrease in distance from rails enhances the proximity effect, but has nothing to do with the skin effect, which also augments the rail resistance, resulting in temperature rise. It can explain the reason why the ablation is often detected in the small caliber railgun. Research results in this paper can provide support for design and optimization of electromagnetic railgun.",
        "A series of plate impact experiments on alumina was conducted using a light gas gun in order to further investigate Hugoniot elastic limit (HEL) and failure properties of alumina under shock compression. The velocity interferometer system for any reflector (VISAR) was used to record the rear-free surface velocity histories of the alumina samples. According to the experimental results, the HELs of tested alumina samples with different thicknesses were measured, and the decay phenomenon of elastic wave in shocked alumina was studied. A phenomenological expression between HEL and thickness of sample was presented, and the causes of the decay phenomenon were discussed. The propagation of failure wave in shocked alumina was probed. The velocity and delayed time of failure wave propagation were obtained. The physical mechanism of the generation and propagation of failure was further discussed.",
        "The accurate research on the hydrodynamics of unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), which moves close to the sea bottom, has a great significance for its maneuverability. The structured grid of the computational models with different distances to the sea bottom and attack angles is generated by Ansys ICEM, and the flow field near the sea bottom is simulated using CFX. The characteristics of the drag, lift, pitching moment influenced by the distance to sea bottom and the attack angle are studied. The result shows that the drag coefficient increases with the decrease of distance, while it increases with the increase of attack angle. There exists attraction force when UUV moves close to the sea bottom, and the attraction force increases with the decrease in distance. The lift coefficient increases with the increase in attack angle. The absolute value of the pitching moment coefficient increases with the decrease in distance and the increase in attack angle.",
        "Friction stir welding (FSW) is a promising welding process that can join age hardenable aluminium alloys with high joint efficiency. However, the thermal cycles experienced by the material to be joined during FSW resulted in the deterioration of mechanical properties due to the coarsening and dissolution of strengthening precipitates in the thermo-mechanical affected zone (TMAZ) and heat affected zone (HAZ). Under water friction stir welding (UWFSW) is a variant of FSW process which can maintain low heat input as well as constant heat input along the weld line. The heat conduction and dissipation during UWFSW controls the width of TMAZ and HAZ and also improves the joint properties. In this investigation, an attempt has been made to evaluate the mechanical properties and microstructural characteristics of AA2519-T87 aluminium alloy joints made by FSW and UWFSW processes. Finite element analysis has been used to estimate the temperature distribution and width of TMAZ region in both the joints and the results have been compared with experimental results and subsequently correlated with mechanical properties.",
        "In support for the development of a new small-arm ballistic computer based on the NATO Armaments Ballistic Kernel (NABK) for the Canadian snipers, DRDC Valcartier Research Centre was asked to carry out high-fidelity 6 degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) trajectory simulations for a set of relevant vignettes for the snipers, and to compare the direct fire 6-DOF simulation results with those obtained with the 4-DOF NATO Armaments Ballistic Kernel (NABK) adapted to simulate small-arm ammunition trajectories. To conduct this study, DRDC Valcartier Research Centre used BALCO v1.0b. This paper presents (1) the process and the methodology employed to carry out the sniper direct fire solution study, (2) the modeling and the simulation of the sniper projectile, the approach used in calculating the firing solutions, and the results of direct fire simulations for the sniper vignettes, and (3) an analysis of firing solutions obtained with the BALCO engine versus those of NABK. The work presented in this paper serves to validate the use of NABK for the new sniper ballistic computer.",
        "The effect of thermite mixture based on aluminum and ferric oxides for ammunition neutralization has been studied and tested. Thermochemical calculations have been carried out for different percentage of Al using Chemical Equilibrium Code to expect the highest performance thermite mixture used for shaped charge ordnance disposal. Densities and enthalpy of different formulations have been calculated and demonstrated. The optimized thermite formulation has been prepared experimentally using cold iso-static pressing technique, which exhibited relatively high density and high burning rate thermite mixture. The produced green product compacted powder mixture was tested against small caliber shaped charge bomblet for neutralization. Theoretical and experimental results showed that the prepared thermite mixture containing 33% of aluminum as a fuel with ferric oxide can be successfully used for shaped charge ordnance disposal.",
        "In order to study the performance of ceramic composite projectile penetrating into ceramic composite target, the contrast test and numerical simulations of the penetration of standard projectile and the ceramic composite projectile into a ceramic composite target were conducted. The results show that the penetration performance of ceramic composite projectile is obvious superior to that of standard projectile for ceramic composite target. The ceramic nose of ceramic composite projectile fully destroys the ceramic panels anterior to its following armor-piercing projectile body, thus maintaining the penetration ability of the following armor-piercing projectile body.",
        "Cellulose acetate nitrate (CAN) was used as an insensitive energetic binder to improve the insensitive munitions (IM) properties of gun propellants to replace the M1 propellant used in 105 mm artillery charges. CAN contains the energetic nitro groups found in nitrocellulose (NC), but also acetyl functionalities, which lowered the polymer's sensitivity to heat and shock, and therefore improved its IM properties relative to NC. The formulation, development and small-scale characterization testing of several CAN-based propellants were done. The formulations, using insensitive energetic solid fillers and high-nitrogen modifiers in place of nitramine were completed. The small scale characterization testing, such as closed bomb testing, small scale sensitivity, thermal stability, and chemical compatibility were done. The mechanical response of the propellants under high-rate uni-axial compression at, hot, cold, and ambient temperatures were also completed. Critical diameter testing, hot fragment conductive ignition (HFCI) tests were done to evaluate the propellants' responses to thermal and shock stimuli. Utilizing the propellant chemical composition, theoretical predictions of erosivity were completed. All the small scale test results were utilized to down-select the promising CAN based formulations for large scale demonstration testing such as the ballistic performance and fragment impact testing in the 105 mm M67 artillery charge configurations. The test results completed in the small and large scale testing are discussed.",
        "This paper reports the effects of post weld heat treatments, namely artificial ageing and solution treatment followed by artificial ageing, on microstructure and mechanical properties of 12 mm thick friction stir welded joints of precipitation hardenable high strength armour grade AA7075-T651 aluminium alloy. The tensile properties, such as yield strength, tensile strength, elongation and notch tensile strength, are evaluated and correlated with the microhardness and microstructural features. The scanning electron microscope is used to characterie the fracture surfaces. The solution treatment followed by ageing heat treatment cycle is found to be marginally beneficial in improving the tensile properties of friction stir welds of AA7075-T651 aluminium alloy.",
        "As part of a research program, an extensive study on the dispersion characteristics of eight different 7.62 × 51 mm ammunition types was conducted. The paper presents the main steps in the experimental and analytical process carried out to evaluate, namely to measure and compare, the dispersion characteristics of the ammunitions; namely, (1) identify the number of rounds to fire in the trials, (2) establish a test plan and the setup for the precision trials, (3) fire the rounds, following an established protocol for the experiments, (4) collect the impact points, and measure the performance through statistical measures, (5) perform a statistical analysis of dispersion applied to the results obtained in the trials, and (6) conclude on the ammunition characteristics. In particular, the paper proposes a statistical method to evaluate the precision of ammunitions fired with precision (Mann) barrels. The practical method relies on comparison of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing on the standard deviation of samples, namely the impact points. An algorithm is proposed to compare the variances of two or more populations of ammunitions.",
        "Four kinds of nitroamine propellants with different RDX contents (10%, 20%, 30% and 40%) were prepared to study the effect of RDX content on the mechanical properties and combustion properties of nitroamine propellant. The mechanical properties and combustion properties of nitroamine propellant at the normal temperature (20 °C) and low temperature (−40 °C) were test by using impact testing machine, drop hammer impact test machine and closed bomb vessel. The test results show that the impact strength of 30% RDX-contained nitramine propellant is maximum, but 40% RDX-contained nitramine propellant has the minimum impact strength. And the crushing height of propellant with 20% RDX-contained was the highest, but the crushing height of propellant with 40% RDX-contained the lowest. With the increase in RDX content in nitramine propellant, the energy of nitramine propellant increases and its burning rate reduces, but 40% RDX-contained nitramine propellant did not meet this trend at the low temperature because of its poor mechanical properties.",
        "A new method based on phase difference analysis is proposed for the single-channel mixed signal separation of single-channel radar fuze. This method is used to estimate the mixing coefficients of de-noised signals through the cumulants of mixed signals, solve the candidate data set by the mixing coefficients and signal analytical form, and resolve the problem of vector ambiguity by analyzing the phase differences. The signal separation is realized by exchanging data of the solutions. The waveform similarity coefficients are calculated, and the time–frequency distributions of separated signals are analyzed. The results show that the proposed method is effective.",
        "This paper presents a study on surface roughness generated by high speed milling of high volume fraction (65%) silicon carbide particle-reinforced aluminum matrix (SiCp/Al) composites. Typical 2D (Ra and Rz) and 3D (Sa and Sq) surface roughness parameters were selected to evaluate the influence of the milling parameters on the surface quality in comparison with aluminum alloy. The 3D topography of the milled surface was studied as well. The results indicate that 3D parameters (Sa and Sq) are more capable to describe the influence of the milling parameters on the surface quality, and among them Sq is preferable due to its good sensitivity. Sq decreases with milling speed and increases with feed rate. The influence of axial depth of cut (ADOC) is negligible.",
        "Long-rod penetration in a wide range of velocity means that the initial impact velocity varies in a range from tens of meters per second to several kilometers per second. The long rods maintain rigid state when the impact velocity is low, the nose of rod deforms and even is blunted when the velocity gets higher, and the nose erodes and fails to lead to the consumption of long projectile when the velocity is very high due to instantaneous high pressure. That is, from low velocity to high velocity, the projectile undergoes rigid rods, deforming non-erosive rods, and erosive rods. Because of the complicated changes of the projectile, no well-established theoretical model and numerical simulation have been used to study the transition zone. Based on the analysis of penetration behavior in the transition zone, a phenomenological model to describe target resistance and a formula to calculate penetration depth in transition zone are proposed, and a method to obtain the boundary velocity of transition zone is determined. A combined theoretical analysis model for three response regions is built by analyzing the characteristics in these regions. The penetration depth predicted by this combined model is in good agreement with experimental result.",
        "Many of the physical and functional properties of RDX and HMX explosives are related to the crystalline structure of these materials. Crystalline defects affect the quality of the explosives. Therefore, in order to enhance the quality of these materials, it is necessary to form crystals with the lowest defects. In this research, we report the optimization of recrystallization process of RDX and HMX by statistical techniques. The solvent/anti-solvent procedure was used for recrystallization of HMX and RDX particles. The four parameters of i) ratio of anti-solvent to solvent, ii) ratio of solute to solvent, iii) aging time, and iv) cooling rate of mixture, were optimized by Taguchi analysis design. Taguchi L16 orthogonal array was used with sixteen rows corresponding to the number of tests in four columns at four levels. The apparent density of recrystallized of RDX and HMX particles was considered as the quality characteristic with the concept of “the larger-the-better”. The obtained graphs showed that the studied parameters were optimized in ratio 1:1 for anti-solvent to solvent, ratio 0.1 g⋅mL-1 for solute to solvent, aging time of 2 h and cooling rate of 1 °C⋅min-1. Also, the correlation between the investigated parameters and apparent density of crystals were studied by multiple linear regressions (MLR) method for obtaining a model of prediction of apparent density. The P-values were indicated that in confidence level of 95%, the null hypothesis is rejected and a meaningful addition is observed in the proposed model.",

The synthesized ANPZO is characterized by IR, laser granularity measurement, SEM and HPLC. The particle analysis revealed that the improved method could offer desired product with average particle size of 40 μm and high purity (>98.45%). The experimental parameters exhibited that the detonation velocity of the formulation based on ANPZO was higher than that of the corresponding TATB formulation. The DSC curve showed that the exothermic decomposition of the product occurred at the temperature between 300.5 °C and 360.4 °C. Furthermore, the sensitivity test suggests its safe nature towards mechanical stimulus.",
        "TEX, a well-known nitramine type explosive, has been subjected to centric perturbations by replacing its etheric (acetal) oxygens with nitrogen atoms one by one. The structural features, stabilities and IR and UV-VIS spectra of new structures formed are investigated. For this purpose, density functional theory has been employed at the B3LYP/6-31G (d,p) and B3LYP/6-311G(d) levels. In general the calculations revealed that the oxygen–nitrogen replacement resulted in more energetic but less sensitive structures than TEX.",
        "Traditional machining methods, such as gear hobbing, gear shaping and gear milling, etc, are commonly used for cutting machining of gear tooth profile, which cannot meet huge machining demand of gears to a certain extent. This article proposes to utilize a face-milling machining method in involute gear machining, which can be used to reduce production cost effectively. Cutting vibration generated during cutting machining has a direct effect on the machining accuracy and machined surface quality of workpiece. Therefore, it is desiderated to perform in-depth research regarding this issue. ADAMS software was used to establish a rigid-flexible coupling virtual prototyping model of face-milling gear milling system and a cutting vibration system model. Cutting vibration analysis was performed for face-milling gear by adopting quick sine frequency sweep method, so that the frequency response characteristics of workpiece in three directions X, Y and Z and space were acquired. The research results will provide reference and theoretical foundation for actual application of face-milling gear machining technology.",

With the development of technology, the tank crew has being gradually decreased, so the research on two-soldier crew tank has become a hotspot. The workload of tank crew under the conditions of informatization is analyzed based on the combat mission of tank and the typical combat scenarios, and the impact of new technologies on workload is evaluated. The crew members in tank can be reduced from three to two, but it is necessary to substantially improve the automation of target search and the reliability of each subsystem and component.",

The changing demography and migration patterns, ethnic and religious tensions, environmental degradation, instability coming from states that are likely to decline or have already fallen, and growing proliferation of weapons are just some of the problems that have exacerbated the differences between security \"then\" and \"now\", such as the transnational terrorist attacks after September 11, 2001. The concept of security was much disputed, as seen from a study of the United Nations in 1986, developed by a group of experts on the concept of security, resulting in the existence of a limited conceptual similarity between them Mankind has always been concerned with building or rebuilding peace and security During the Cold War, Central and Eastern European countries were not talking about a national security concept in the Western sense of the word, but about a military doctrine of the Warsaw Pact and, in some cases, as was that of Romania, about a national military doctrine. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, those countries have gradually chosen to use the concept of national security, a term that takes into account all types of threats to national interests, and also the whole range of ways to counter them, the military not having the leading role any longer.

        "It is obvious that the infrastructure for defense represents a vital necessity for every nation in the context of the present day processes of European and international integration. Provision of current security, both at the European and national levels, depends on the transformation triggered by the European economic integration, and by the national economic development, but terrorism, corruption, and labor migration are causing new risks and threats. Therefore, the redefinition of the\r\ntraditional security concept is necessary by taking into account the non-conventional risks. Mankind has come to the conclusion that the security interests and objectives of the European states can be accomplished only by European and international cooperation, because neither state, no matter its power, can ensure security on its own. Owing to NATO adherence and EU integration processes, there was an important transformation of our country's strategy and the configuration of Romania's active role within the two democratic organizations on the basis of necessary resources preservation.

        "This paper is about how the conceptualization of ‘culture’ in intelligence studies has taken on too powerful a role, one that has become too restrictive in its impact on thinking about other intelligence communities, especially non-Western ones. This restriction brings about unintentional cognitive closure that damages intelligence analysis. The argument leans heavily in many ways on the fine work of Desch and Johnston in the discipline of Security Studies, who cogently brought to light over fifteen years ago how ultra-popular cultural theories were best utilized as supplements to traditional realist approaches, but were not in fact capable of supplanting or replacing realist explanations entirely. The discipline of Intelligence Studies today needs a similar ‘intellectual intervention’ as it has almost unknowingly advanced in the post-Cold War era on the coattails of Security Studies but has largely failed to apply the same corrective measures. This effort may be best accomplished by going back to Snyder in the 1970s who warned that culture should be used as the explanation of last resort for Security Studies.\r\n",

        "Introduction: Stress urinary incontinence is a highly debilitating condition, with an important impact over the quality of life. When the conservative treatment fails, the surgical treatment is a viable solution. Minimally invasive sling procedures have become the gold standard of surgical management for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women.\r\nMaterial and methods: The study was conducted on 68 patients with stress urinary incontinence, 52 have undergone the retropubic tension-free vaginal tape and 16 patients were operated using the transobturator tape procedure. All the patients were evaluated before the operation and the indication of the surgical treatment was established on the basis of physical examination (all the patients had positive cough test), abdominal ultrasound (to determine postvoid residual urine volume), urinalysis and urine culture (the majority of the patients have had before the operation\r\nrecurrent urinary tract infections).\r\nResults: The satisfaction was similar in both groups of patients, with an average satisfaction rate of 91% for TVT and 86% for the patients who have undergone TOT procedure. The patients were in a proportion of 78,9% at menopause, with an average number of natural births of 1.9 and a mean BMI of 28.2. Regarding the surgical duration, this has varied between 20 and 40 minutes, being higher in the TVT cases (up to 5-7 minutes longer than TOT), because cystoscopy was performed during the operation to verify if the bladder was perforated or not. The urethral catheter was removed immediately after the operation in the case of the TOT procedure and in the day after the operation for the patients who have undergone TVT procedures (all of these patients associated genital prolapse). The hospitalization time was 3 days. We haven’t encountered significant intraoperative and postoperative complications.\r\nConclusions: The TOT and TVT procedures have proven to be highly effective and safe methods in the treatment of SUI. There are no significant differences regarding the efficacy of these two\r\nsurgical methods, but the risk of intraoperative complications is a little higher for the TVT procedure. The mid urethral sling procedures improve significantly the quality of life for patients\r\nwith stress urinary incontinence.",
        "The article intends to provide an alternative perspective to examine the radicalization process. It rejects the causal paradigm in favor of a discursive approach that focuses on understanding psychological phenomena as revealed in discourse. My central argument is that a discursive approach offers greater explanatory power than is offered by the causal, reductionist approach that currently dominates the field. My article concludes by offering an interdisciplinary framework that uses discursive psychology as a mode of explanation to better understand how radicalization may occur at the individual level in various sociocultural contexts as a product of lived experience. The framework employs positioning theory as an analytic tool to examine discursive exchanges to provide insight into pathways to the development of radical belief systems among at-risk youth.\r\n",

        "TLarge-scale defense system projects are strategic for maintaining and increasing the national defense capability. Therefore, governments spend billions of dollars in the acquisition and development of large-scale defense systems. The scale of defense systems is always increasing and the costs to build them are skyrocketing. Today, defense systems are software intensive and they are either a system of systems or a part of it. Historically, the project performances observed in the development of these systems have been signifi cantly poor when compared to other types of projects. It is obvious that the currently used systems development life cycle models are insuffi cient to address today’s challenges of building these systems. Using a systems development life cycle model that is specifi cally designed for largescale defense system developments and is effective in dealing with today’s and near-future challenges will help to improve project performances. The fi rst step in the development a large-scale defense systems development life cycle model is the identifi cation of requirements for such a model.

        "Robotics and Artificial Intelligence complement surgical technical expertise and judgement. A robot’s accuracy in the programmed performance of predesignated tasks is exquisite. Historically, with the evolution of microsurgery, senior surgeons designated delicate suture placement to more steady handed, sharper eyed young fellows or even nurses. Tactile feedback and ultrasensitive pressure velocity controls make robotics a viable but expensive option to fine surgical assistance.\nAutonomous surgical robots are however a distinct paradigm. Myriad unfathomed mysteries of human pathophysiology and anatomy confer upon surgical procedures complexities which defy stratification and simplification into sets of preordained tasks. In the current scenario where fuzzy logic, neural networks and intuitive computing are still in early evolution, robots replacing master surgeons seem as improbable as Google self driving cars in formula one racing.\nRobots have evolved as dextrous, fatigue and tremor free surgical tools. The data crunching capability of computers is improving in speed and in capability for machine learning. Human surgical maturity on the other hand is attained and matures through phases of information assimilation, knowledge consolidation and attainment of surgical wisdom. Human surgeons at the helm will, in this decade harness robotic capabilities and information template paradigms to fine tune many procedures and to augment surgical reach. Quantum leaps and paradigm shifts towards robotic surgical autonomy may be neither desirable nor practical.",
        "Background: Health and medical issues are one of the most important aspects of disaster relief, as populations recovering from the aftermath of a disaster are extremely vulnerable from injuries and other health problems. Effective disaster management invariably involves complex health challenges and regional cooperation.\nHealth Aspects of Disaster Cycle: The health aspects of a disaster are analysed according to the tools of the conventional disaster cycle to identify priority areas.\nHealth challenges: Certain pertinent issues like, short and long term health burden, damage to health facilities and infrastructure and cost effectiveness of external aid are discussed which are outside the pale of the conventional disaster cycle approach.\nSalient features of disaster medicine: Quality control, epidemiological research, legal and ethical issues are crucial aspects of disaster medicine which need to be addressed.\nRegional cooperation: The role of regional cooperation to meet the health challenges should have a symbiotic approach.",
        "Background: Anaphylaxis reactions are common during the use ofASV. We are reporting a case of ASV induced pulmonary edema in a 23 years old male with history of viperine snake bite.\nCase Report: A 23 years old ill looking male presented with swelling and pain left lower limb, was febrile with tachycardia, respiratory rate of 24/minute, Blood Pressure of 90/60 mm Hg and 02 saturation of 96% at room air. Local examination of revealed two puncture marks with edema andpetechiae. His bedside 20 min whole blood clotting test (WBCT) was deranged. The patient was given 10 vials of anti snake venom and after 90 mins of ASV administration, the patient became restless, with a temp of 104°F, pulse rate of 144/min, BP of140/70, RR of 38/min and Sp02 of 74% at room air with bilateral coarse crackles over all lung fields. Urgent chest x-ray suggested pulmonary edema. He responded well to symptomatic management.\nDiscussion: Up to 80% of patients treated with antivenoms present with adverse effects like anaphylactoid or pyrogenic reactions, or late serum sickness4. In our case, the pulmonary edema was not due to the snake bite neither was it due to fluid overload. Pulmonary edema developed 90 mins after ASV administration.\nConclusion: Direct causation of pulmonary edema due to ASV should be kept in mind while managing snake bite cases.",
        "Generally Nobel laureates are known and celebrated because of the discoveries for which prizes are awarded. Many of them possess unknown facets which are to be celebrated with equal recognition but go unreported because the award winning discovery overshadows other facets of the individual. Nobel prizes were awarded first time for achievements during the year 1901. During the first part of 20th century most of the individuals awarded were medical graduates and several among them were practicing doctors. While looking at the winners, few of them achieved remarkable landmarks in other fields but these “facets” were not known widely. Sir Frederick Grant Banting, Co discoverer of Insulin, researched in Aviation and Diving Medicines along with the gifted team of scientists and results when applied saved thousands of lives of flight crew. He was also the youngest to be awarded the prize and achieved it in a span of 3 years since commencement of research.",
        "Military medicine is one of the most diverse fields of medicine and diving medicine forms an integral part. Diving medicine in fact grew out of concerns for military divers and till today the primary training and research involve military diving. Today, diving medicine training is faced with numerous challenges, right from lack of understanding and exposure of undergraduates to diving medicine, to a lack of awareness in the mainstream medicine fraternity. This paper is intended to deal with some current challenges facing the specialty and offers certain solutions. The solutions would mostly involve cooperation and collaboration of international agencies, organizations, and various countries to make a joint effort to resolve these challenges and take the field of military diving medicine forward.",
        "Objective: Psoriasis is a chronic, relapsing and disfiguring dermatological disorder with a significant effect on occupational, social, and other areas of functioning. Psychological stress has been known to have a significant role in the onset and exacerbation of this illness. To study the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in psoriasis and the influence of specified demographic, psychological, social and illness-related variables. Methods: The study was carried out at a tertiary care hospital in a large urban setup. In this case–control study, 100 cases of psoriasis were studied in comparison with healthy controls who were matched for sociodemographic profile. The participants were given a sociodemographic questionnaire, clinical profile sheet, and psoriasis area and severity index (PASI). General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) was used to screen for psychological distress, and subsequently, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale for screening for depression and anxiety and World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF scale for assessing the quality of life (QOL) were administered. The results obtained were analyzed for evaluating the psychiatric morbidity and its various correlates. Appropriate statistical analysis was done using SPSS 21. Results: Using GHQ-12 cutoff score (≥3) for psychological distress, the overall prevalence of psychological distress was significantly more in cases of in comparison to healthy controls with an odds ratio of 8.54 (95% confidence interval 3.16–23.07, P < 0.0001). Statistical analysis showed a statistically significant correlation of educational status with QOL and severity of skin lesions (PASI) with anxiety level. Severe skin lesions, more so on visible body parts were associated more commonly with psychological distress. Conclusions: All patients of psoriasis should be educated about the nature of the illness and screened for psychological distress. Dermatologists and family members should be educated to recognize the symptoms early and encouraged to seek the help of psychiatrist.",
        "Objective: To report on our clinical experience (safety and efficacy) of intraarticular injection of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid in symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Methods: In this prospective, experimental pre post efficacy, non-comparative study, 39 patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) were treated with single intra-articular injection of high molecular weight (HMW) hyaluronic acid (Hylan G-F20). Pain visual analogue scale (VAS) and WOMAC scores were evaluated at baseline, after three and six months. The study as completed over one year. The change in VAS and WOMAC score from baseline was calculated for patients who completed all three visits. Results: The mean age of participants was 55.5 (+10.9) years; mean duration of OA was 4.8 (+3.1) years. Of the 39 patients, 12 patientshad grade 2 OA, 26 patients had grade 3 OA and one patient had grade 4 OA. Thirteen patients completed all three visits, and seven patients completed baseline and three month evaluation. The median VAS score reduced from 6.5 (+2.1) at baseline to 3.5 (+2.1) at 3 months and 4.5 (+2.2) at 6 months, P = 0.01 (vs Baseline). The median WOMAC score reduced from 52.5 (+18.5) baseline to 23 (+13.5) at 3 months and 33 (+17.5) at 6 months, P = 0.0004 (vs baseline). Study medication was well tolerated. None of the patients reported any adverse event. Conclusion: In our experience intra-articular HMW hyaluronic acid (Hylan G-F20) is a good and safe therapeutic option for patients with mild to moderate knee OA to reduce pain.",
        "Background: Health information is one of the most accessed topics online. Worldwide, about 4.5% of all Internet searches are for health-related informationand more than 70, 000 websites disseminate health information. However, critics question the quality and credibility of online health information as contents are mostly a result of limited research or are commercialised. There is a need to train people to locate relevant websites where they can efficiently retrieve evidence based information and evaluate the same. The study was conducted with the objectives of determining the prevalence of use of internet for accessing healthcare information amongst literate adult population in an urban area and to assess the association between the demography and the reasons of internet use. Methodology: We used an anonymous, cross sectional survey completed by a sample of out patients of 408 individuals who came to a tertiary care centre at Pune during the year 2015. The survey consisted of 17 questions related to behavioural, attitudinal and demographic items. Results: Out of the total of 408 individuals, 256 (63.2%) individuals used internet for health information though 332 (82.4%) of them were aware of authorised websites for health information and 69 (16.9%) thought information available in the internet can be harmful. Also, 63 out of 256 (24.6%) agreed to the fact that they ask questions to their doctors based on the information that they acquired from internet while surfing about that particular disease/ ailment. More individuals (p<0.05) who were working and who were educated, graduates and above, were using internet for health information. Conclusion: Our results suggest the great potential for using the internet to disseminate the information and awareness to the public about health and healthcare facilities. However, it is important to disseminate credible information from reliable and authorised websites assigned for health since online healthcare information can reach target masses within a very short span of time.",
        "Owing to many advances in anesthetic techniques, perioperative sophisticated monitoring as well as surgical techniques, there has been an exponential increase in the geriatric patients presenting for elective as well as emergency surgeries. Perioperative period in the elderly is more prone to adverse outcomes due to factors such as advanced age group, limited functional capacity, multiple comorbid conditions, impaired cognition as well as limited support at the home front. The severity of illness is a better predictor of outcomes if compared with the age. The perioperative risk of mortality and morbidity in elderly patients increases all the more if the surgery has to be performed in an emergency. We present a series of three cases, highlighting perioperative concerns and management of elderly patients undergoing emergency neurosurgeries at our institution.",
        "Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are life-threatening complications of solid-organ and bone marrow transplantations leading to a high mortality. PTLD represents a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative diseases. They become clinically relevant because of the expansion of transplantation medicine together with the development of potent immunosuppressive drugs associated now with a long survival. The risk of PTLD is highest in the early posttransplant period, but the cumulative risk increases with time. We report a case of two sequential malignancies – carcinoma bladder - 13 years and now gastric lymphoma - 15 years after renal transplantation in a 73-year-old male.",
        "Idiopathic scrotal calcinosis (ISC) is a rare and benign disorder first described by Lewinski in 1883. It is characterized by the presence of multiple yellowish-white calcified asymptomatic nodules gradually increasing in size, appearing in the scrotal skin. It appears mainly in men aged 20–40 years. Histopathology ISC reveals calcium deposits within the dermis that may be associated with giant cell reaction. The calcified intradermal nodules that are seen in this condition occur in the presence of normal calcium and phosphate metabolism. Many studies done on this entity spanning over the past years have failed to demonstrate its origin. Though few studies suggest this entity to be a result of dystrophic calcification in a preexisting cyst, many other studies failed to demonstrate histological evidence to the same. Hence, whether this condition is idiopathic or as a result of dystrophic calcification of preexisting cysts including epidermal, eccrine epithelial cyst, or degenerated dartos muscle remains a controversial issue. Associations with connective tissue diseases such as scleroderma, dermatomyositis, and systemic lupus erythematosus have also been known. Surgical excision is the gold standard treatment for this disease. We report two cases, one in a 59-year-old and other in a 47-year-old male, with no known comorbidities, both presenting with asymptomatic multiple hard scrotal nodules. Both the cases revealed dermal deposits of calcium with normal serum calcium and phosphate levels. There was no evidence of keratinous material, epithelial-lined cystic spaces, or preexisting duct-like structures within or around the foci of calcification, suggesting this entity to be distinct from dystrophic calcification in a preexisting cyst. Surgical excision was done with no evidence of recurrence.",
        "Background: Breast lesions are always a diagnostic challenge and range from benign to malignant. Fine-Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) is done in patients with breast lesions. However, to get an accurate and diagnostic yield is difficult at times. Aims: The aim of this study is to highlight the role of triple approach in diagnosing breast lesions. Design and Setting: This is an observational prospective study carried out in the Department of Pathology at a tertiary care hospital over 2 years. Materials and Methods: One hundred and fifty cases of breast lump were studied. Clinical findings, imaging findings, and cytology along with histopathological findings were correlated. Results: Cytological findings were benign in 102 out of 107 patients, who were otherwise clinically and radiologically benign. In rest five patients, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (BIRADS) BIRADS II category was given on mammography. In four of these five patients, there was cytological atypia. Biopsy in these four patients showed features of fibroadenoma with mild cytological atypia and one patient showed infiltrating duct carcinoma. Mammography was suggestive of malignant breast lump in 43 patients. In three patients, breast lump was diagnosed as benign on cytological examination. However, histopathological examination confirmed the mammography findings of malignancy. Conclusion: FNAC is a well-established procedure for diagnosing breast lesion but has got many pitfalls. Hence for diagnosis a breast lesion, the triple approach consisting of histopathological examination in addition to mammography and FNAC, should be considered.",
        "Background: An outbreak of food poisoning occurred among recruits in a training establishment. Investigation of outbreak was undertaken with active preventive interventions concurrently to arrest the current outbreak as well as to avoid such incidents in future. Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study was undertaken among all recruits, regardless of presence or absence of symptoms. The risk ratios (relative risks) and attributable risks were calculated for each food item of the suspected meal to assess the association between consumption of individual food items and subsequent illness. An environmental survey was undertaken to investigate into the course of food processing and storage facilities at trainees' galley (cookhouse) and other relevant eating establishments. Results: A total of 494 recruits reported with symptoms of gastroenteritis in a span of 3 days. Of those affected, only 9 were admitted and rest recovered with treatment on OPD basis. The overall attack rate was 22.9%. No deaths were reported. It was a classical point source, single exposure gastroenteritis outbreak. When food histories and sickness histories were analyzed, the attributable risk (24.17) and relative risk (5.11) were highest for the “Flavoured milk,” which was an outsourced item. The statistical findings were substantiated with environmental and epidemiological evidence. Conclusion: Epidemiological investigation incriminated dinner of the previous day as the meal responsible for the outbreak with flavored milk as the most attributable food item.",
        "Introduction: In confined afloat settings, the threat of an acceleration of the Influenza outbreak is substantial, causing high morbidity of the personnel on board, disrupting daily activities, and leading to low crew morale. In this study, H1N1 Influenza outbreak in a Naval Warship and its control measures are described. Materials and Methods: It is a study of 21 clinically suspected cases of H1N1 Influenza. Cases were reported within 3 weeks from a ship company, all of whom were susceptible. They have been described on the basis of demography, clinical features, recent travel history, and history of contact. Results: Mean age of the clinically suspected cases was 26.71 years. Of 21 suspected cases, 14 were found positive for the disease. Nine cases were admitted to the hospital and two developed complications. Attack rate of the disease was 4.83%. Conclusion: In confined afloat settings, prompt public health measures of active case finding, strict isolation, and adherence to hand hygiene, following cough etiquettes and disinfection enhancement, can effectively mitigate the outbreak. Vaccination may not have a role to play if preventive measures are instituted effectively.",
        "Background: Community acquired Pneumonia (CAP) can be defined clinically as the presence of signs and symptoms of pneumonia in a previously healthy child caused by an infection acquired outside a hospital. CAP is a substantial cause of childhood morbidity and mortality throughout the world. We studied the clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological features of CAP and its complications in children admitted to a tertiary care hospital.\nMaterial And Methods: This is a retrospective observational study of 50 children aged 2 months to 14 years admitted under Paediatric care at a tertiary care hospital in Mumbai between Jan 2014 to April 2015. Pneumonia was diagnosed based on evidence of consolidation on chest radiograph and lor presence of clinical findings suggestive of pneumonia.\nResults: The mean age of children was 4.5 years with range from 4 months to 13 years. Male to Female ratio was 0.98:1. 16 children had pre-existing risk factors. 65% children had history of fever? 5 days with tachypnea noted in 3 2 % children and 2 0 % had SP02 < 95%. Tachypnea was noted in 32 % of children. As per WHO clinical classification, the distribution of pneumonia as very severe pneumonia, severe pneumonia; pneumonia; and no pneumonia was 4%,2%, 32% , 62% respectively. However 42% of children as no pneumonia as per WHO criteria had evidence of pneumonia on chest radiograph and remainder 20% had clinical findings on auscultation. 80% of study subjects had evidence ofpneumonia on chest radiograph. Average length of hospital stay was 7.2 days. A l l children were started on intravenous antibiotics. Complications developed in 5 patients. 4% of patients died in our study which co-relates with the outcome in developed nation.\nConclusion: Community acquired pneumonia has been on the decline in developed countries due to newer vaccines, anti-microbial therapy, advances in diagnostic modalities and excellent access to healthcare; childhood pneumonia still remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries.",
        "Introduction: Febrile seizures are the most common seizures in children less than five years of age and occur in 2-5%. They are mostly benign with an excellent prognosis. Despite its benign nature, the febrile convulsion is one of the most common reasons for admission .The present study was aimed to study the demographic, clinical & laboratory profile in children admitted with febrile seizures for the first time and compare with other similar studies.\nStudy Design: A descriptive prospective study conducted in a tertiary care centre. A l l children admitted with Febrile Seizure for the first time; aged 06 mo - 60mo were enrolled. Diagnostic criteria as per ??? Clinical Practice Guidelines, 2008 were used. Patient's demographic and clinical data were obtained. Laboratory investigation for each patient was guided by clinical examination. The cause for the fever was evaluated and managed with antibiotics wherever indicated .The data was analysed by using Microsoft Excel.\nResults: There were 75 children which constituted 5.7% of total Paediatric admissions. Mean age of presentation was 27.78mo (± 15.16 mo) with peak in less than 2 years of age. At presentation, Simple febrile seizure was observed in majority (85.3%). Mean duration of seizure was 1.25 (± 1.23 ) min. Majority of children (n=54, 72%) developed seizure within 24 hours of onset of fever and around 17.3% had positive family history. The upper respiratory tract infection was the most common cause of fever (92%) and around 84.1 % did not require antibiotics. Around 44% of children had microcytic hypochromic anaemia. Recurrence was observed in 4% of patients. The average length of stay (ALS) was 3.4 (+1-2.4) days.\nConclusions: Parents should be appropriately counselled regarding prophylaxis and benign nature of illness. The yield of investigation remains low and does not justify extensive workup or prolonged hospitalization. As most of the cases are of viral etiology, antibiotics should be used with discretion.",
        "Sepsis is the most common cause of neonatal mortality in developing countries accounting for approximately 30-50% of neonatal deaths. Early diagnosis and treatment of neonatal sepsis is crucial for a favourable outcome. Early onset sepsis can presents within hours after birth and is usually acquired from the maternal genital tract. The clinical signs may be subtle and close monitoring of high risk patients is warranted in this scenario. Late onset sepsis usually presents after seventy two hours of birth and the source of infection in this situation is usually nosocomial or community acquired.\nBlood culture and sepsis screen are two most important diagnostic as well as corroborative investigations in this situation which also help in deciding the appropriate treatment. Presence of polymorphs in gastric aspirate at birth points towards chorioamnionitis and could be used as a n additional parameter of sepsis screen for diagnosing early onset sepsis. Other useful investigations include lumbar puncture, urine culture and chest radiography. An array of newer diagnostic tests is now available for early diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. These tests are highly sensitive and also have a high negative predictive value.\nThe treatment includes supportive care along with administration of appropriate antibiotics. Adjuvant treatment includes IVIG, GCSF, exchange transfusion and pentoxifylline administration. This paper aims to present an algorithmic approach to neonatal sepsis to expedite the diagnosis along with providing appropriate and adequate treatment.",
        "Introduction: Oxygen toxicity is a major limiting factor in underwater combat operations and Clearance diving operations. It is imperative to screen in the induction phase of military diving, those individuals who have lower threshold of oxygen toxicity to avoid it during combat diving operations. In addition, susceptibility to oxygen toxicity is a n entity not only for combat diver but for all divers as in the event of Decompression Sickness (DCS), they shall be exposed to oxygen partial pressures up to 2.8 ATA for prolonged durations as part of standard treatment protocols. A susceptible individual might suffer from oxygen toxicity during a therapeutic recompression.\nOxygen Tolerance Test: Oxygen Tolerance Test is a standardised procedure to evaluate the oxygen susceptibility of prospective divers. A physiologically sound protocol based on internationally accepted norms has been developed. Standards of Fitness and Unfitness have also been clearly delineated.\nConclusion: By following a standardised protocol for Oxygen Tolerance Test, an objective assessment and recordkeeping is possible. This shall entail a more effective screening during the initial diving medical examination.",
        "Introduction: Diving is a n operational commitment of navy. Diving operations are conducted with I without the presence of a MM spl. Study of MM done along with phases of attachments at different diving operational units as practical orientation.\nClasses of Divers: (a) Ship Diver (SD). Trained to dive up to 35 MSW (b) Clearance Diver (CD): They are trained to dive up to 55 MSW. (c) CD (DD): They are Deep divers, also trained in saturation diving using Helium Oxygen mixture, (d) Chariot Diver: They are combat divers of the Navy. (e)Air crew diver: Specially trained SD & CD. (f) Combat Diver: from Army.\nDiving Establishments: Diving School - shore estt, kochi. INS Nireekshak - floating platform. INS Satavahana - submarine training estt - shore estt, vizag. INS Abhimanyu - chariot diving with pure Oxygen breather for clandestine operations. CCDH! - one per command, CDU at A & N. INS Matanga, INS Gaj - floating platforms. Recompression Chamber Complex, INHS Asvini\nDecompression Sickness: Due to metabolically inert gases and due to fast ascent rate. It is never with pure oxygen diving. Never occur while at bottom. As per grading, Type I - not serious type, generally known as bends and Type II - serious type\nTreatment: Treatment for DCS is followed as per guidelines promulgated in INBR 2806. Mainstay of treatment remains with Oxygen Table 61 & 62 of INBR 2806 which is same as RNBR 2806 as table 5<fUS navy Diving Manual.\nIncidences: Incidences of DCS are found at Diving School and Nireekshak. At ETS other diving related injuries like Mask injury, hypoxia, CAGE are documented. At CCDTk no DCS documented in last five years.\nConclusion: DCS in Navy is rather very less due to stringent training, fitness of divers and proper follow of procedures.",

        "Choledochal cysts are rare cystic dilatations of the biliary tree. Most of them are congenital and usually manifest in early childhood but some may manifest later in adult life. Though, the cause is uncertain, these cysts are usually referred for surgical resection because of their association with recurrent inflammation, infection and malignancy [1]. Traditionally choledochal cysts are classified into 5 main types. Cysts of cystic duct are a rare entity which have been sometimes described as Type VI choledochal cyst according to modified Todani′s classification [2]. Till 2009 only 14 such cases have been reported [3]. We describe a rare case of type VI choledochal cyst i.e. cyst of cystic duct, which was treated successfully by laparoscopic resection.",
        "With recent advances in medicine, the number of prepubertal and adult males surviving cancer treatment has increased dramatically. This has increased the need to improve the existing technology and search for new fertility preservation options. Presently, only sperm cryopreservation has been accepted in standard clinical practices. Fertility preservation options in prepubertal males are still experimental and there are many unresolved issues related to these technologies.

        "Background: A large number of neonatal conditions can be anticipated before or identified at birth. Many of these conditions need venous sampling of neonates to determine hematologicalparameters. There are no studies to show whether the easily available umbilical cord sample can be used to obtain these test parmeters in full-term neonates.\nMaterials & Methods: This retrospective, one-year study included full-term neonates with conditions that can be predicted before birth (infection in the infant of a mother with prolonged rupture of membranes, Rh negative mothers′ infant, Intra-uterine growth retardation, transient tachypnoea ofnewborn following caesarean section) or at birth (birth asphyxia). Umbilical cord blood hemoglobin, total and differential leukocyte counts and platelet counts were compared with the same parameters obtainedfrom venous blood drawn from neonates within six hours of birth. \nResults: A total of 49 neonates were eligible and included. The mean (s.d.) values of parameters for cord blood were 15.49 gm/dL (3.36) for hemoglobin; 12695.26/dL (6181.49) for total leukocyte count; Ploymorphs 48.61% (15.97); Lymphocytes 39.46% (15.83); Eosinophils 4.17% (2.2) and Monocytes 4.7% (2.27) while mean platelet count was 254.4 × 103/dL (91.5). The same parameters for venous blood were mean hemoglobin of15.78 gm/dl (2.76); TLC13373.47/dL (6499.16); Ploymorphs50.04% (14.45);Lymphocytes41.08% (15.26); Eosinophils 4.14% (2.2) and Monocytes 4.7% (2.19) while mean platelet count in venous blood was 265.76 × 103/dL (88.54). There was no significant difference between the cord blood value and the venous blood value of any of the above hematological parameters. \nConclusions: This study shows that there is no difference in the hematological parameters tested in cord blood or venous blood collected within six hours of birth in full-term neonates. Larger studies are needed to confirm this finding and evaluate the benefits to neonates after which cord blood testing can routinely substitute venous blood testing for these hematological parameters in neonates with conditions as described in this study.",
        "Objective: To analyse and discuss the role of multidector CT in the assessment of disease spectrum of oesophageal carcinoma.\nMaterials & Methods: Multidetector CT (MDCT) images of 48 cases of histopathologically proven oesophageal carcinoma were retrospectively reviewed. Axial images in soft tissue, lung and bone windows were analysed along with multiplanar reconstructions wherever necessary. Imaging findings of local extension to various structures were analysed and assessed. The extent of involvement and various complications were also evaluated using established criteria. Involvement of regional and distant lymph nodes as well as distant metastases and their imaging appearances were analysed. A scanning protocol for lungs and abdomen with appropriate intravenous contrast delay with bolus tracking was used to allow biphasic study of the liver.\nResults: Of 48 cases of oesophageal carcinoma studied, 20 hadperilesional fat involvement, 12 had involvement of the tracheobronchial tree, 10 of the aorta, 2 showed pericardial involvement, 3 had pleural involvement, 5 cases showed gastric invasion, 1 showed direct infiltration of lung parenchyma and 1 case had involvement of the bone by the primary tumour. In 14 cases there was regional lymph node involvement and 4 showed non-regional node involvement There were 11 cases which showed metastatic lesions in the lungs, 8 with metastatic deposits in the liver and 3 with bony metastases. Multidetector CT improves spatial resolution, allows volumetric imaging, muliplanar reformats and enhances confidence in image assessment\nConclusion: CT is a widely available and useful investigation in the work up of oesophageal carcinoma. It is an excellent tool for noninvasively determining the extent of oesophageal carcinoma and assessing its resectability. Multidetector CT imaging improves spatial resolution and allows greater confidence in image analysis in addition to providing reformats. Biphasic examination of the liver can routinely be achieved when scanning for chest and abdomen. MDCT should be used routinely in the pretreatment staging and follow-up of the majority of these cases.",
        "Background: The epidemic of non communicable diseases has begun its tragic shift towards the developing world. This survey was undertaken to find out prevalence of alcohol and tobacco consumption amongst Armed Forces personnel posted at Mumbai serving in various Ships & Shore establishments.\nMethods: The survey was a cross sectional descriptive study based on a questionnaire which was answered by 1531 service personnel\nResults: It was found that the prevalence of alcohol consumption was 55.32% and that of tobacco consumption was 18.61 %. 65.18% individuals were aware that alcohol use is injurious to health and 91.18% felt that tobacco use is injurious to health.\nConclusion: Despite the high level of awareness for harmful effects of alcohol and tobacco, the prevalence of consumption was above 50% for alcohol thereby showing that more effort in the form of Behaviour Change Communication is required to be undertaken. This should address issues of hazards pertaining to alcohol consumption: the adverse effect on both the individual and his family leading to loss of man days thus affecting the moral fibre of the Armed Forces.",

The reportedprevalence of LBP in Indian population is highly variable, and ranges from 6.2% to 92%. The etiology of LBPcovers a vast number of factors including mechanical, psychogenic, degenerative, post traumatic and inflammatory causes. Meticulous history taking andphysical examination are of utmost importance while dealing with a case of LBR Various classes of medicines are available with promising results for control of LBR Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs, selective COX2 inhibitors, muscle relaxants, opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin etc. Non pharmacological intervention like spinal manipulation and acupuncture are of controversial effectiveness. Yoga and physiotherapy have evidence supporting their role in improving the pain. Strong need is there to improvise the conventional method of managing LBR Approximately 95% cases of LBP are of non speciJic mechanical wherein diagnostic imaging tests (including X-rays, CT and MRT) are not routinely indicated for acute non-specifi LBR Investigations should be limited for the small minority (<2-5%) where the cause of back pain is suspected to be either inflammatory (ie. systemic autoimmune diseases viz. ankylosing spondylitis or spondyloarthritis) or sinister. Active rehabilitation should be encouraged and the patients should not be prescribed bed rest as a treatntenf Management of LBPrequires an umbrella approach which, apart from pharmacological intervention, screening for psychosocial prognostic indicators in LBP may ultimately guide treatment protocols in physical therapy for more comprehensive patient care along with patient empowerment in terms of health education, participation in decision muking and responsibility of taking good self-care.",

        "Objective: This study is to share our experience of using vascular closure device (VCD) after anterograde femoral arterial access at cardiac cath lab. Background: Vascular access site management is crucial to safe, efficient, comfortable, and cost-effective diagnostic or interventional percutaneous cardiac procedures. As per the literature, femoral artery access site complications following angiographic procedures range from 1% to 5%. The Angioseal VCD has been shown to be safe and effective in reducing the time to hemostasis following angiographic or other cardiac interventional procedures. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective, observational study carried out at a tertiary care hospital of the Armed Forces. All patients in whom Angioseal (St. Jude Medical) were deployed after undergoing either diagnostic coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) through common femoral artery access. All patients from January 2011 to December 2016 in whom VCD was either deployed or attempted were included in the study. Results: A total of 16245 patients were taken up for femoral access for diagnostic procedures and PCI from 2011 to 2016. We observed 98.52% success rate with Angioseal and a mere 1.48% complication rate. Out of the complications observed, only 2 (0.13%) patients had the serious complication of limb ischemia rest were all minor complications. Conclusion: Our observations and experience with the Angioseal VCD are a safe, efficient, and resulting in more favorable patient outcomes.",
        "Introduction: Evaluating Otoacoustic Emissions (OAEs) is one of the audiological methods for ototoxicity monitoring. The absence of OAEs indicates cochlear damage. The aim of this study was to study the usefulness of OAEs in early detection and prevention of ototoxicity. Materials and Methods: A prospective, comparative study was conducted to evaluate Transient-Evoked OAEs (TEOAEs) and Distortion-Product OAEs (DPOAEs) as they relate to Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA) in cases of ototoxicity. Hearing assessments of study group of 55 individuals exposed to ototoxic drugs were evaluated and compared at regular intervals, within the group and with control group of 25 individuals using PTA, TEOAEs, and DPOAEs. The abnormal OAE responses were calculated as predictive of significant changes in PTA thresholds. Student's t-test (independent samples, two-tailed) and ANOVA used for analysis.  Results: PTA thresholds in the study group remained unaffected in the first three follow-ups whereas TPOAEs and DPOAEs were both found affected at the third follow-up, in significant number of ears in the study group. Significantly lower PTA thresholds were found in study group only at the fourth follow-up. Conclusions: Changes in TEOAEs and DPOAEs precede changes in PTA thresholds in ototoxicity and have high sensitivity and specificity in predicting hearing loss in such cases.",
        "Disease transmission occurs with a perfect balance of the epidemiological triad consisting of an external agent, a susceptible host, and an environment that brings the agent and host together. Conflict situation is an ideal platform that creates this confluence of agent and host in perfect environmental conditions, for pathogens to tear through soldiers and refugees alike. Classically during armed conflicts, soldiers and displaced population get exposed to unsanitary and overcrowded barracks, trenches, refugee shelters, and concentration camps with disruptive health-care services. Many get susceptible to diseases prevalent in the relocated region and some may introduce pathogens in the native population. The earlier wartime epidemics were considered as divine interventions and wrath of God. As medicinal knowledge advanced, prevention strategies evolved from isolation and quarantine to sanitary measures against miasma and further to chemoprophylaxis and immunization against the pathogen. The advent of antivector chemicals and antibiotics revolutionized the control of epidemics during the World War II. Although not infectious in origin, modern-day outbreaks are mostly health events such as posttraumatic stress disorders in postwar or war-like scenario. This article chronicles the epidemiology of the better-known wartime epidemics.",

        "The main purpose of building breakwaters is to produce \r\nsafe havens for ships and boats in rough \r\nseas.  The general architecture for a breakwater is a wall with a trapezoidal\r\n-shaped cross section extending \r\nparallel to the shoreline.  As the waves from the open sea approach, they are encountered by the so-\r\ncalled\r\nslope  and  revetment  of  the  breakwater,  where  the  wave  is  broken  and  its  energy  is  dissipated  and/or  \r\nreflected  back.\r\n  However,  the  ever\r\n-increasing  attractiveness  of  the  utilization  of  waves  as  energy  sources,  \r\nparalleling to the increasing monetary and envir\r\nonmental costs of energy, has led the authors to consider the \r\nvast  amounts  of  this  otherwise  dissipated  energy  into  useful  electrical  energy.    A  wave  energy  conversion  \r\nconcept, which can be classified as an “overtopping” wave energy converter was conceived, where the open \r\nsea-facing  (revetment)  side  of  the  breakwater  is  fitted  by  a  water  collecting  channel  at  a  suitable  height  \r\nabove the calm water level, running alongside the breakwater.  The channel leads the collected water to a \r\npowerhouse containing a low head turbine (or a set of such turbines) discharging it to the calm water of the \r\ninner harbour.  Power obtained from these turbines can be converted to electrical energy.  In this study, an \r\nestimation  of  the  volume  of  water  collected  by  the  channel  and  the  energy  production  for  a  proposed  \r\nbreakwater \r\n- power station system for a typical rough weather shall be made. \r\nIt is deemed that the feasibility of this system is comparable to and even higher than the other wave energy \r\nconversion systems since it does \r\nnot require additional facilities and power supply lines to be built due to its \r\nproximity to the existing energy transmission lines, except for the addition of new features/installations to the \r\nexisting breakwaters.",

        "The development of navigation systems requires more and more accurate base data. Currently, attention is paid to utilization of geophysical fields — gravitational and magnetic ones — for navigation purposes. The Earth’s magnetic field distribution — both onshore and offshore — is complicated and variable in time. Hence, it is essential to precisely know the secular variations in the area of interest. In the case of Baltic Sea, this involves establishing (re-establishing) of a marine network of secular points (repeat stations) and regular magnetic measurements of the three independent components of the Earth’s magnetic field. Such measurements require equipment that ensures not only high stability, but also information about sensors’ orientation in relation to geographic north and to the level. This article presents a new project of the Baltic network of repeat stations and gives a solution for the instruments usable for quasi-absolute magnetic measurements.",

        "The methods of automatic pilotage along a guided path are well known in the practice of navigation. However these methods have a number of drawbacks, which reduce the effectiveness of their application. It is especially important for river-sea vessel in poor visibility. Because of the large inertia of the vessel and its hydrodynamic properties that are changed by external influences, the process has unstable oscillatory nature. Therefore the vessel moves not in a straight line, but on a winding curve having the general direction that corresponds to the specified value. In this paper new method of coastal navigation with invented new devices supported with satellite navigation receiver is presented.",

        "Many surveying companies and maritime institutions are now using multibeam systems for their operations, either offshore or in coastal and inland waters. Since the time the first multibeam echosounder appeared (late 1970s) the technology has advanced enormously. Modern systems now boast far greater angular coverage (typically 120°-150°) and form hundreds of beams. Dual-head multibeam systems can potentially cover the entire sector (180°) underneath the ship. However surveyors must be aware that the outer beams of these acoustic systems return the most errors causing that the effective swath width is shorter than what the manufacturers declare. The paper presents the methods of estimating of effective (usable) swath width of dual-head multibeam echosounder EM 3002D. Results of the hydrographic survey performed by the polish navy survey ship ORP ‘Arctowski’ have been showed in the article.",

        "The present survey, as part of larger project, is devoted to properties of pure linear models of yaw motion for directionally stable ships, of the first- and second-order, sometimes referred to as the Nomoto models. In rather exhaustive way, it exactly compares and explains both models in that what is being lost in the zigzag behaviour, if the reduction to the simpler, first-order dynamics (K-T model) is attempted with the very famous [Nomoto et al., 1957] approximation: T = T1  + T2 - T3. The latter three time constants of the second-order model, more physically sound, are strictly dependent on the hydrodynamic coefficients of an essential part of the background full-mission manoeuvring model. The approximation of real ship behaviour in either of the mentioned linearity orders, and the corresponding complex parameters may facilitate designing and evaluating ship steering, and identifying some regions of advanced nonlinear models, where linearisation is valid.",

        "Objective: Very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm neonates are fed every 2 hourly (2H) or 3 hourly (3H), but there is not sufficient evidence to determine the best feeding schedule. The study objectives were to compare the effects of 2H or 3H feeding schedule in neonates weighing <1500 g at birth, on the incidence of feed intolerance, apnea, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), hypoglycemia, and time to attain full feeds. Design and Setting: This longitudinal observational study was conducted in a level III neonatal unit of a teaching hospital in North India between October 2012 and March 2014. Materials and Methods: All stable intramural neonates born <1500 g were eligible for the study. Neonates with major malformations, congenital heart diseases, gastrointestinal anomalies, and those contraindicated for enteral feeding as decided by the treating clinicians were excluded. Sixty VLBW preterm neonates were assigned to 2H or 3H feeding groups. The incidence of feed intolerance, apnea, NEC, hypoglycemia, and time to attain full feeds was assessed. Results: There was no difference in incidence of feed intolerance between the two groups (30% vs. 23.3%, P = 0.56). The incidence of apnea, NEC, hypoglycemia, and time to attain full feeds was also similar between the two groups. Conclusion: 3H feeding is possibly as good as 2H feedings for VLBW neonates.",

        "Peran protein dalam proses pembentukan biosilika yang terjadi di dalam tubuh beberapa biota laut telah menginspirasi peneliti untuk mempelajari dan meniru teknologi tersebut untuk aplikasi industri. Dengan proses biologi biasa, protein dari spikula spons dan dinding sel diatom dapat berfungsi menjadi cetakan dan mendirect proses biosilika berskala nano. Isolasi dan identifikasi protein tersebut, yang dilanjutkan dengan uji coba proses biosilika secara in vitro, memperlihatkan potensi protein tersebut sebagai biokatalis/agen biologi dalam sintesis silika. Sintesis silika secara kimia, seperti dalam produksi bahan resin, katalis, dll, selama ini dikenal merupakan proses yang tidak ramah lingkungan dan boros energi (diperlukan suhu, pH dan tekanan tinggi). Karena itu, eksplorasi dan riset lebih lanjut mengenai protein ini dirasa sangat penting mengingat bahan dasar silika, termasuk didalamnya teknologi nano, telah dipergunakan dalam berbagai bidang industri termasuk diantaranya industri pangan, elektronika, otomotif, dan lain-lain. Perkembangan riset tentang protein ini, baik yang telah dilakukan oleh peneliti luar negeri maupun yang dilakukan di Indonesia, serta aplikasi teknologi nano-silika akan disampaikan pada makalah ini.",
        "Research was conducted to produce and characterize bacteriocin produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from rusip, a traditional Bangkanese fermented fish product. Experiment was started by isolation of lactic acid bacteria from rusip, followed by screening to obtain the best isolate which has the highest bacterial inhibition activity. The selected isolate was then identified and used to produce crude bacteriocin. The crude bacteriocin was characterized through its stability in high temperature and proteolytic enzymes, inhibitory spectrum, pH sensitivity and effect of surfactants. The result showed that CN1.10a isolate which was identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp lactis has the highest bacterial inhibition activities; therefore it was selected to produce crude bacteriocin. The bacteriocin produced was heat stable, sensitive to proteolytic enzymes i.e. proteinase-K and papain but not to RNase. It inhibited Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Lactobacillus plantarum. It stable at pH 2.0 to 6.0. Among surfactans used sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), lauryl sarcosine and EDTA were able to stimulate bacteriocin production, while the production were strongly inhibited by Tween 20, Tween 80, Triton X-100 and urea. Based on the above characteristic, the bacteriocin was suitable to be used as a preservative of food which has to be processed at high temperature.",

        "In many countries, most of household goods are made from polymer or plastic. The polymer manufacturing industry has been relying on fossil fuel-based raw materials which are non-biodegradable. Plastics derived from these non-biodegradable sources will be difficult to degrade in nature, which in turn will pollute the environment and harm the ecosystem. One way to reduce the ecosystem damages caused by petroleum-based plastic is by using biodegradable materials for plastic industry, such as Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). Poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) or PHBV is an example of PHA that can be produced by several types of microorganism, one of them is marine archaea Haloferax mediterranei. The objective of this study is to determine the productivity of marine archaea H. mediterranei cultures to produce PHBV with yeast extract as main nutrient sources. Experiments and analysis were conducted in triplicate and batch operating system. During the fermentation process, optical density, glucose levels, phosphorus levels, pH, and dry cell weight (DCW) were observed. The final product was then analysed using GC-MS to determine 3HB (3-hydroxybutyrate) and 3HV (3-hydroxyvalerate) fraction composition in the PHBV. The results showed that the maximum specific growth rate (m) and doubling time (Td) of the H. mediterranei were 0.1258 hours-1 and 5.51 hours, respectively. H. mediterranei biomass increased until it reached stationary phase after 95 hours incubation. The PHBV content, dry biomass and yield of PHBV to substrate were 2.62 g/L, 29.1% and 0.27 g/g, respectively.",
        "Marine environment continuously produces pharmacologically active compounds. To screen marine natural products as a source of potential antibiotics, it is very important to select an accurate and efficient antibacterial assay. This study aims to find out the best assay for screening of antibacterial activity of marine invertebrate extracts by comparing the performance of 3 methods, i.e. the colorimetric resazurin microtiter assay (REMA), disc diffusion assay and spectrophotometric microdilution assay (SMA). Five marine invertebrate extracts, i.e. Stylissa sp., Theonella sp., Lobophytum sp., Sarcophyton sp., and Aaptos sp., were tested using those 3 different methods. The best method obtained was then further tested for its performance to screen 126 marine invertebrate extracts against 2 bacterial strains i.e. Escherichia coli (ATCC®25922TM) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC®25923TM). The study showed that, resazurin microtiter assay (REMA) was simpler, produced quicker result and able to generate reliable data for antimicrobial activity screening compared to the other methods. Moreover, REMA assay is regarded as a suitable assay platform to be implemented for screening of marine invertebrate extracts antibacterial activity since it requires only a small amount of extracts. Based on the MIC values, amongst 126 marine invertebrate extracts screened, 59; 36; 25 and 6 extracts tested against E. coli and 69; 36; 18; and 3 extracts tested against S. aureus were respectively categorized as not active, moderately potential, potential and very potential sample worth to be analyzed further.

        "Chitosan-starch blend film showed desirable elongation and oxygen transmission rate (OTR) values and demonstrated rapid degradation in soil burial treatment. The incorporation of higher glycerol concentration lowered tensile strength but increased the amount of transmittable water vapour. The biodegradability of chitosan-starch based film was tested using soil burial test. Chitosan-starch blend films were able to degrade naturally at slightly similar period, ranging from 72–87 days. The addition of glycerol was likely contributed to the high Water Vapour Transmission Rate (WVTR) value which faster the biodegradability of the film in soil. Among different type of acid solutions, lactic acid is less preferable solution to dissolve chitosan as it produced film with poor mechanical properties compared to acetic and formic acid. Based on its mechanical limitation, the film can be used as a coating based film for certain type of fish product, especially product with high lipid content.",

This paper is meant to generate some discussion that may hopefully help to bring about some measure of conceptual clarity. The first part of the paper is an attempt to identify the different approaches to understanding the basic nature of the Islamization process itself. Here, we differentiate between two approaches: the \"engagement\" of modern social sciences scholarship and the \"disengagement\" therefrom. It is pointed out that the truth seems to lie somewhere in between the two approaches. The second part of the paper asserts that the term \"Islamization\" is being used in many confusing ways. A case is made for limiting the use of this term to Islamization of “Knowledge,\" rather than expanding it to Islamization of societies, or reducing it to the level of talking about the Islamization of \"curricula.\"</em></p>",
        "How can a person in financial difficulty solve his problems? Islam gives the paradoxical solution of giving charity: the more you give, the more you get. Low-income earners should be encouraged to give charity as a means to free themselves from financial difficulties. This paper investigates the charity giving behaviour of low-income groups using an empirical study of factors affecting their regular charity giving. A total of 101 low-income households with monthly incomes of around USD80 in Jakarta were interviewed using the administered questionnaire approach. The data were analysed using logistic regression. The results highlight specific factors that significantly influence regular charity giving behaviour among the low-income households in Indonesia. This study hopes to provide important inputs to the relevant authorities and society on how to educate low-income households to manage their financial resources.<br /><br />",

        "This paper aims at exploring the concept of al-dharā’i‘ in its broad meaning, both at the preventive and proactive levels (sadd and fatḥ al-dharā’i‘). The application of al-dharā’i‘ at both levels plays a significant role as a practical mechanism towards the realisation of maqāṣid, due to the cause-effect relationship between means and objectives. Thus, the legality or the Sharī‘ah value of an act could be determined based on its possible results in procuring benefits and/or preventing harm. Islamic Insurance has been considered a new development in fiqh al-mu‘āmalāt. The current debate is not on the question of legality of insurance as a concept and practice but rather to provide an Islamic model of insurance that conforms to the criteria of the Sharī‘ah that helps realise its objectives. Due to the unavailability of direct texts on this issue, some practical aspects of insurance depend largely upon the predominance of either beneficial or evil ends. This paper will, therefore, look into some controversial issues prevailing in insurance practice and an attempt will be made to review the issues within the framework of realisation of Maqāṣid al-Sharī‘ah via the application of dharā’i‘ both at preventive and proactive levels.",

        "Abstract: Terrorism is an old phenomenon but its modern manifestation was first noted in the 19th century with the anarchist group who assassinated Czar Alexander II in 1881. Since then it has continued unabated but its intensity and frequency increased in the 21st century. This study examines the trends in international terrorism and, in particular, analyses its causes and consequences. Based upon extensive literature and documentary research, this study found at least three perspectives that explain terrorism either as a reaction to socio-economic deprivation or as the product of religious fundamentalism or as a legitimate struggle to wipe out injustices perpetrated by the powerful against the powerless.  Muslims condemn terrorism and suggest that the Western powers cease their policies of victimising the vulnerable populations, of sponsoring terrorists, of siding with Israel, and of denying others their right to liberty and sovereignty.",
        "<p>God’s revelations, as the main source of knowledge, do not deny, in any way our brain’s functional capabilities. The Quran acknowledges the necessity and importance of the brain. Islamic epistemology regards the brain as the second source of knowledge after the revelations. The holistic perspective on knowledge that is gained by mankind is that it is constructed by man in the context of their thinking culture, education and social concepts. Therefore, in this regard, thinking method directly relates to the objectives of Islam and its Sharia, and gives a significant implication towards understanding and developing Sharia as a dynamic knowledge area. This study combines three (3) methods, content analysis; historical method and comparison of the review of the history of the construction of Islamic thought and the review of screening methods Sociology Society background. The discussion this article covers the definition and concept of scientific thinking skills and scientific Islamic thought and the approaches of critical thinking in Islamic scientific thought. In reality, Muslims are not prohibited by their religion to think scientifically through scientific thinking methods, provided that it does not contradict with Islam.

        "Stopping short of declaring a specific number, the Qur’ān states that God has sent many prophets/messengers to various nations. Among the names listed in the Qur’ān, none is clearly identified as a woman. Nevertheless, on numerous occasions the Qur’ān states that certain female figures have received inspiration from God. Ibn Ḥazm (d. 456/1064) argues that, by virtue of their reception of authentic inspiration, these female figures were prophets. They were the mothers of the prophets Isḥāq, Mūsā, and ‘Īsā, as well as the wife of Fir‘awn. The study identifies philological, God’s inspiration, logical, and perfection concept as four approaches Ibn Ḥazm used for his arguments. Upon critical analysis, we conclude that, although logically presented in accordance to his <em>ẓāhirī</em> (literalist) dispensation, Ibn Ḥazm’s theory of the prophecy of women lacks sufficient Qur’ānic support. Beginning with Ibn Ḥazm’s brief background and his <em>ẓāhirī</em> tendency, the study critically engages Ibn Ḥazm’s own theory, and comprehensively analyses the four approaches employed for his conclusions.",

The diversity is issue that from time to time produces turbulences, especially at the line of two main identity groups Macedonians-Christian Orthodox and Albanians-Muslim community.\n\nQuantitative data in this study were obtained on a sample of 219 young adults from Skopje (95 of Macedonian and 17 of Albanian ethnicity) and Tetovo (76 of Albanian and 31 of Macedonian ethnicity), aged from 18 to 35 years (M = 24.85, SD = 3.2). Main research question is that if there exist differences between young Macedonians and Albanians in their ethnic, religious and national identity? The objective of this paper is to give a scientific picture how categories as gender, marriage, family, ethnicity, religion, living place, Balkan, Europe are perceived by the youth, all this in favour of using them in producing affirmative actions, more productive societal policies and constructive society-building. Multiple social identities: their complexity and inclusiveness, the correlation of identity variables with SII and SIC are among issues analyzed in this paper. National dominance was more frequent among Macedonians. Our findings demonstrate that Albanian participants expressed strong social identity, as Albanians and as being Muslims. Only social identity inclusiveness is significantly related to societal and political attitudes, but ethnicity should be taken into consideration when this relationship is explored.",
        "Privatization is considered an initial step toward market economy, restructuring financial and economic sector that enables competition in the economy. Privatization is the most painful process in economy where beside legal establishment and political will, it includes also the aspect of fairness and honesty. Analysis of this process is based on the models and comparisons between Kosovo and countries of central and Eastern Europe, in order to give a clearer picture on the overall process of privatization in Kosovo\n\nMethodology that is used to analyze this issue is based on empirical results and also qualitative interpretation of the models and also on studying particular asset privatization process. A widely discussed case of privatization in Kosovo is that of Post and Telecom of Kosovo (PTK). Since each company has its own value, I have focused my appraising analysis on the financial statements with a special observation on Cash Flow from Operation, as the most significant indicator on showing how company is using her physical and human recourses to generate money. I have based my research on using methodology of discounted cash flow from operation analysis, even though the company valuation was done using net cash flow from operation analysis. Cash Flow valuation then was discounted by the T-bonds interest rate.\n\nThis paper tries to bring a conclusion that privatization process in Kosovo have not brought the results excepted, firstly by setting an inappropriate price of assets and lastly by restructuring overall privatization sector and the overall industry. Kosovo, consequently, lost a big opportunity to create a competitive environment of financial industry: starting from the banking industry followed the pension trust which remained at their initial steps of development",
        "Abstract: The significance of tribal identity in Jordan can be seen in the special relationship of traditional institutions with the state, which shows both the fluctuation in the concept of tribalism and how tribalism can be better understood by viewing it through the perspective of “Jordanian nationalism”. This relationship has created confusion on the local and national levels about how the state system should work through its institutions. Furthermore, the process of democratization is only a façade; Jordan is supposedly a constitutional monarchy, but in fact the king holds absolute power. The parliament’s autonomy has been minimal, in other words, the parliament is a symbol of democracy but is widely perceived as non-representative. This paper examines the regime security strategy “Jordan First” and the particularity of Jordanian identity through its relationship to the concept of a Jordanian national consensus.",
        "To explore how Chinese Buddhists acted as trailblazers of Engaged Buddhism, I shall analyze a late nineteenth-century thinker, Tan Sitong 譚嗣同 (1865–1898). The focus of my analysis is his masterpiece, <em>Renxue</em> 仁學. From his position of Buddhist eclecticism, Tan discoursed at length on non-differentiation as the truth of the universe to reflect on the creative disposition of human agency. He described in <em>Renxue</em> how this disposition would contribute to the agendas defining Chinese modernity. In addition, discussing the meanings of non-differentiation, Tan also generalized about the nature of the human agency he attempted to advocate: while he perceived the human agency blessed with a non-differentiating mindset as an omnipotent history-making force, he also argued that it did not confer upon its owner the status of world savior. In fact, in his view, the efficacy of a non-differentiating mind was determined by the world it aimed to help. Tan's signature piece, I argue, provides a lens through which we can observe modern Chinese Buddhism's role as an important part of the global formation of Engaged Buddhism.",

The electorate voted on the basis of “bread and butter” issues which were highlighted by the ruling coalition as well as the opposition parties.",
        "<span>Since the late 1990s, the Dalai Lama's \"Kalachakra for World Peace\" initiation has emerged as a central site where Tibetan Buddhism and its relationship to the West have been imagined and acted upon by a movement within evangelical Christianity called Spiritual Mapping. In Mapping understanding, the Kālacakra is a vehicle by which the current Dalai Lama prepares for the end times by seeking to transform America into \"a universal Buddhocracy\" called the Kingdom of Shambhala. Tibetan Buddhism is, in short, a missionary competitor for global religious domination. Here, the Tibetan-evangelical encounter is presented as the by-product of the simultaneous globalizations of Tibetan Buddhism and Evangelicalism with the human rights discourse in late twentieth century America. The \"exorcism of the mandala\" is read as both by-product and critique of globalization, and to engender a thoughtful re-evaluation of long-standing Buddhist Studies analytics.</span>",

The soundness of the application of the <em>Shar&lsquo;īah </em>and related policies is subject to the degree of universality and flexibility of the Islamic rulings with changing circumstances, are discussed from various viewpoints in this paper<em>. </em>After a survey of the system of values that <em>Maqāṣid al-Sharī&lsquo;ah </em>represent, three methods are explored: (1) differentiating between scripts that are means (<em>wasā&rsquo;il</em>) to higher ends and scripts that are ends (<em>ahdāf</em>) in their own right, (2) preferring a multi-dimensional understanding for the conciliation of opposing juridical evidence, instead of reductionist methods such as abrogation (<em>naskh</em>) and elimination (<em>tarjīḥ</em>), and (3) achieving a universality of <em>Sharī&lsquo;ah </em>across cultures via the consideration of customs (<em>al-&lsquo;urf</em>). A number of examples are provided throughout the paper in order to explain the impact of the proposed methods on contemporary Islamic rulings and juridical policies related to them.</span><strong><em></em></strong></p>",

Using documentary sources, the paper argues that Islamic law is far superior than the International law as enshrined in the Geneva Conventions and the United Nations Charter on the treatment of prisoners of war. It found the abuse of the prisoners at Abu Ghraib a routine operation carried out in obedience to orders issued by the higher authorities. The photographs portraying images of dehumanization in Abu Ghraib is unacceptable either in Islamic or international law.</span></p>",
        "Human rights has been acknowledged as one of the essential characteristics of good governance. Abuse of human rights is strongly associated with bad governance, which is believed by many to be a serious impediment to development and sustainable growth. Despite the active participations of Islamic movements in many parts of the political world, very little is known of their involvement in advocating human rights issues as part of their struggle for power. Nevertheless, as an Islamic movement and an Islamic revivalism actor in Malaysia, Pertubuhan Jamaah Islah Malaysia (JIM) has shown otherwise. JIM has resembled a different attitude towards the issue of human rights that they believe as an integrated and pertinent composition of good governance. By scrutinising their political activities and discourse since 2000, it becomes clear that JIM has been actively engaged in good governance and human rights issues, especially those that relate to the political rights of citizens through its involvement in the Abolish Internal Security Act (ISA) Movement (Gerakan Mansuhkan ISA). This paper examines JIM’s involvement in human rights issues with a special focus on its active and leading role in calling for the abolishment of the Internal Security Act (ISA).",
        "The advertisement is a form of marketing communication which is used to encourage, convince or manipulate an audience (the viewers, listeners or readers, sometimes a special group) to take or to continue taking some actions. Advertisements have an important role in increasing sales. Successful ads that result with the growth of sales require competent personnel including a number of specialists; therefore it is very necessary to choose the personnel carefully, to ensure firms a stable position in the market. Advertisement costs are quite large, but they have to be in accordance with the growth of sales. From the collected and analyzed data, we can conclude that kosovar businesses pay great attention to advertisements and share their budget for them. In this paper, the importance of advertisements in sales growth is explained, as well as how many ads do they do, how much budget do they share for this, for which kinds of media do they share more budget and what obstacles they encounter during the advertising. The paper consists of two parts: the part of literature review that is connected to the topic and the research part. Primary data was used for the realization of the paper, which was obtained through questionnaires by direct contact with the general managers, marketing managers, directors and owners with a wide knowledge about advertisements in enterprises. For the realization of this paper, quantitative methods were used.",

The notion of mysticism and mystical practices\nare also employed to refer to something different, one referring to Sufi tradition,\nand the other referring to authentic Javanese mystical practices.\nIn addition, authors’ perspectives matter. Particular understanding of some no-tions applied from the beginning of the observation has been guided the attention\nto particular aspects of religious life. Certain understanding about Islam has made\none author emphasize more on the aspects of Islam, rather than different reli-gious tradition. On the other hand, an empty-assumption-like autor to conduct\nobservation on religious life of Javanese has been easily fallen to the dominant\nview of previous examination on the field. Those factors may lead to using differ-ent sort of data. If a single religious tradition like Islam is considered, the useful resources are textual, since they tell much about the general development of the\ntradition. However, while no single religious tradition is considered more impor-tant than others, one may find that ethnographical account is the best way to see\nwhat kind of religious traditions exist and how the traditions are perceived and\npracticed. Lastly, as the leading notion and the subsequent sort of data used are\ndifferent, the aspects of a religious tradition are emphasized differently, one the\ngreat and the other the little tradition. Therefore, the awareness -that ‘there is\nsubjective involvement in the process of knowing’ is confirmed in this thesis. It\nhas been proven by the fact that different findings of the same field research are\ncaused by the ways researchers approach the problem. In fact, they have differ-ent approaches.\nTelah terbukti bahwa perbedaan temuan dilapangan dalam penelitian tentang\nkeberagamaan masyarakat Jawa dipicu adanya perbedaan pendekatan penelitian.\nPerbedaan tersebut diantaranya adalah perbedaan cara memaknai beberapa\nkata kunci. Kata ‘Islam’ oleh satu peneliti didefinisikan secara luas, sementara\noleh peneliti yang lain didefinisikan secara sempit. Pembahasan tentang Slametan\njuga ditekankan pada aspek-aspek yang berbeda oleh masing-masing penulis.\nHasilnya, sementara yang satu menunjukkan bahwa upacara tersebut Islamik,\nyang lainnya cenderung animistik. Wacana tentang paham dan praktek mistik\njuga dikembangkan mengarah pada klaim yang berbeda, yang satu tradisi Sufi,\nyang lainnya paham kebatinan asli Jawa.\nSelanjutnya,  beberapa  point  penting  terkait  dengan  perspektif  yang\ndikembangakan oleh peneliti. Istilah kunci yang dipegang sejak awal menuntun si\npeneliti untuk menekankan pada beberapa aspek kehidupan keberagamaan. Is-lam yang menjadi faktor penentu mengarahkan si peneliti untuk lebih banyak\nmenekankan data dan penafsirannya pada Islam, daripada tradisi keagamaan\nlain. Disisi lain, karya yang nampak diawalnya tanpa pretensi apapun tentang\ntradisi keagamaan tertentu, bahkan mudah jatuh pada tuntunan karya-karya\nsebelumnya. Faktor-faktor tersebut mengarahkan para peneliti untuk memakai\nperangkat data yang berbeda. Jika yang banyak diperhitungkan sejak awal adalah\nsuatu tradisi keagamaan tertentu, misalkan Islam, sumber yang lebih berguna\nadalah text, untuk melihat perkembangan umum dalam beberapa tingkat tradisi.\nNamun jika tidak ada prioritas satu tradisi tertentu, si peneliti menganggap bahwa\ncatatan ethnography akan lebih banyak berguna. Taerakhir, adanya perbedaan-perbedaan yang telah disebutkan tadi akan mengarahkan pada penekanan pada\naspek-aspek tradisi yang berbeda.\nDengan demikian, keyakinan bahwa ‘ada pengaruh subjective dalam proses\nmengetahui’ sebagaimana yang dikembangkan oleh sosiologi pengetahuan telah\nterbukti dalam. Faktanya adalah pernbedaan temuan lapangan dipengaruhi oleh\nsecara apa masalah penelitian tersebut didekati. Nyatanya, perangkat penelitian\nyang mereka gunakan memang berbeda.",
        "<p><em>The paper discusses the issue of distributive justice from social and Islamic perspectives. In the former, an attempt is made to examine research conducted in the social and organizational context, while in the latter the issue is deliberated in the light of Islamic concerns, values and practices. Distributive justice is concerned with the norms of resource allocation and perception of fairness by the recipients. The norms may be merit, need, or equality. Which norm is perceived as fair depends upon several factors, such as type of resource, purpose of allocation, and relationship characteristics between the allocator and the recipients. Islamic view on distributive justice emphasizes its humanistic concerns. It subsumes three principles, namely, </em><em>ʿ</em><em>Adl, Ins</em><em>ā</em><em>f, and Ihs</em><em>ā</em><em>n. The religion accepts merit as the basis of resource distribution yet adopts measures to minimize inequalities. The paper discusses the concept of Zakah in this context.</em></p>",
        "Abstract: The transformation of Johor under Abu Bakar has been variously described as modernisation or westernisation. Westernisation argument is flawed because during the period under consideration, Johor was not yet fully under the control of the West. The archival records show that Johor’s transformation was self-initiated to promote the welfare of the people. The reforms Abu Bakar brought about in Johor affected more the Malay culture than Islamic rules and practices. Even then these reforms not simply modernised but elevated the position of certain aspects of Malay culture. It is, therefore, appropriate to describe Abu Bakar as the father of modern Johor.",
        "The human faces with various problems already in its first steps in live, and carriers of such life situations are found in various ages which bring new currents in the way of life. Starting from the ancient Greek thought, the human and its mind made the centre of the world, already orienting the Western thought towards the study of the human mind (namely human reason), since it made the key tool for human survival. Although human problems have been discussed throughout various ages, they have not been able to resolve in full the human problems, and therefore, the same issues were taken by the representatives of the socalled “critical theory”, who used the theory to criticize the way of live Western civilization was offering, known as digitalization of the human mind. The human problems are addressed in a poly-dimensional manner. The factors affecting the human mind are: industrial civilization, technical progress, automation, overtly influence of machinery on humans, substitution of cultural values, which in sum have developed a new World Order, where the ruler is technology. In the modern world, the human fails to recognize himself, since he is out of himself and lives according to the rules set forth by the “remote control”. In the flow of this kind of livelihood, human alienates, or in other words, the human goes out of himself, trying to adapt maximally to the requirements of the new way of life.",

These changes contained fairly challenges, but important is that the situation normalized and is moving towards positive trends of legislative development.\n\nActually, in Kosovo, property rights are receiving deserved attention, but it is somewhat worrying the emphasizing lack of the review of the registration, reason that encouraged me to elaborate this topic in order to gain more knowledge about the institute of registration system and complexities that accompanies it.",
        "This article describes a comprehensive study of ISIS (the Islamic States of Iraq and Syiria) by examining both their historical and ideological roots, Shi’ite or Sunni – including their patterns and terror motives and also by mapping their doctrinal understanding that they adopt. The data stem from various studies, books and news that are widely spread in mass media by literature study (library research). This study was inspired by the emergence of ISIS which in recent years has shocked the world for their savagery and ferocity in committing the murder. Moreover, their leader (Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi) has declared himself as the caliph and called on Muslims worldwide to join them. That issue has been a controversy across the Muslim world; many Muslim groups accepted and joined the ISIS, while others rejected its presence. Based on these library research results, it can be inferred that, historically ISIS has existed since 2004 and the origin of ISIS cannot be separated from the existence of Tawhid wa alJihad. In terms of doctrine, the concept of shared leadership of ISIS tends to lead to Sunnis, although al-Baghdadi himself does not meet the criteria to be appointed as caliph. Personally, al-Baghdadi does not posses the leadership capacity required as a caliph, based on one of the caliph’s criteria, that is ‘adalah (justice) that he does not have. Artikel ini, dengan menggunakan pendekatan kualitatif, mengkaji akar sejarah dan ideologi ISIS, Syi’ah atau Sunni –termasuk di dalamnya pola dan motif teror–, kemudian memetakan paham doktrinal yang mereka anut agar diperoleh kajian yang komprehensif tentang ISIS. Data diperoleh dari studi kepustakaan (library research) yang berasal dari berbagai hasil penelitian, buku, dan berita-berita di media massa. Penulisannya terinspirasi oleh kemunculan ISIS yang pada beberapa tahun terakhir telah menghebohkan masyarakat dunia, karena kebiadaban dan keganasannya dalam melakukan pembunuhan. Selain dari itu, Abu Bakar al-Baghdadi sebagai pemimpin ISIS, mengangkat dirinya sebagai khalifah dan menyeru umat Islam di seluruh dunia untuk bergabung ke dalam kelompoknya.Deklarasi yang sepihak itu mendapatkan respons beragam. Sebagian kaum muslimin memilih menjadi anggota ISIS, sedangkan yang lain menolak kehadirannya, karena ISIS dinilai melakukan kekerasan hingga menjurus kepada pembunuhan. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian ini, secara historis ISIS sudah ada sejak tahun 2004 dan asal muasal ISIS tidak terlepas dari keberadaan Tauhid wa al-Jihad. Dilihat dari segi doktrinal, konsep kepemimpinan yang dianut ISIS cenderung mengarah ke Sunni, meskipun al-Baghdadi sendiri tidak memenuhi kriteria untuk diangkat menjadi khalifah. Secara personal, kapasitas al-Baghdadi sebagai pemimpin, belum dapat terpenuhi secara sempurna, karena unsur ‘ada>lah (adil) yang semestinya ada dalam diri seorang pemimpin, tidak ia miliki.",
        "The development of the third wave of Information and Communication Technology is accompanied by the growing concern on the decline of an individual’s ability to think sharply and wisely. In Malaysia, this concern has brought to fore the prominence of teaching thinking skills within the school system and teachers were expected to be the agents of this change. Are teachers aware of the importance of this thinking ability? Have they been adequately prepared for this paradigm shift? Do they personally feel competent teaching for thinking in the classrooms? This survey attempts to answer these questions and investigates the relationship between teachers’ attitudes and practices. It also examines if there exists any significant differences in teachers’ beliefs and their practices with respect to gender, course attendance and teaching experience. Finally, it explores some of the problems faced by teachers in teaching for thinking.",
        "This article discusses two different types of contemporary writings both\n“scholarly feminists” and “internet commentators” on women in Islam;\nparticularly issues related to gender equality such as women’s rights, status\nand creation. By comparing two different groups of writers, the objective of this\npaper is to discover whether there are significant differences between them on\nissues of women in Islam, which shed light on modern Islamic thinking. From a\nbrief investigation of several books as representatives of scholarly feminists, and\nseveral websites, which publish many articles on women in Islam, as\nrepresentatives of Internet commentators, it is clear that both groups seem to\nhave similar attitude on the topic. They tried to clarify a common misperception\nof women in Islam which is commonly portrayed to be “a second class”. Moreover,\nit is clear that the message of ‘Internet commentators’ seem to be more\neffective and more likely to prevail.\nArtikel ini membahas dua tipe tulisan-tulisan kontemporer, baik dari kalangan\n“feminis terpelajar” maupun “komentator internet” mengenai perempuan dalam Islam; utamanya berkaitan dengan persoalan-persoalan keadilan gender, seperti\nhak-hak kaum perempuan, status dan penciptaan mereka. Dengan\nmembandingkan dua kelompok penulis ini, tujuan artikel ini adalah untuk\nmenemukan apakah ada perbedaan signifikan antara kedua kelompok ini mengenai\nmasalah-masalah perempuan dalam Islam yang mewarnai pemikiran Islam\nmodern. Dari penelitian singkat atas beberapa karya yang mewakili kaum feminis\nterpelajar dan beberapa websites yang memublikasikan banyak artikel tentang\nperempuan dalam Islam, sebagai representasi dari komentator internet, jelas\nbahwa dua kelompok ini memiliki keserupaan sikap atas topik tersebut.

        "This article examines conflicts and violence experienced by Ahmadiyah commu-nity in Indonesia after reformasi era. In spite of diversities among Muslims in\nIndonesia, Ahmadiyah (Jemaat Ahmadiyah Indonesia) has been experiencing some\nforms of violence both from other Muslims and government. The number of\nviolence has risen dramatically after the issuing second fatwa from Majelis Ulama\nIndonesia in 2005 and the Joint Ministerial Decree (SKB) on Ahmadiyah. Those\nforms of violence are issuing decree on banning Ahmadiyah, sealing the mosques\nand banning of doing religious activities, and mobbing the mosques and houses,\nincluding killing. Furthermore, this paper argues that Indonesia’s goverment does\nnot take its responsibility to protect its people particularly from minorities groups,\neven some local governments also do violence towards Ahmadiyah community.\nArtikel  ini  membahas  konflik  dan  kekerasan  yang  dialami  oleh  komunitas\nAhmadiyah di Indonesia setelah masa reformasi.

        "This Research Paper by Dr. Alex P. Schmid opens with a brief exposition of the foreign (terrorist) fighter (FTF) phenomenon, concentrating on Salafist jihadists and their astonishing growth after the Caliphate was proclaimed in mid-2014. The author then discusses various definitions of FTFs. Subsequently, Dr. Schmid seeks to bring structure and order into the widely diverging estimates of the numbers of foreign fighters. He then identifies problems posed by foreign fighters for European democracies with Muslim diasporas, focusing on the range of motivations driving vulnerable young men and women – mainly second generation immigrants and recent converts to Islam – to join the so-called “Islamic State”. Having identified push and pull as well as resilience factors that facilitate or inhibit young Muslims joining ISIS, he argues that stopping them from departing to Syria is not enough; political solutions have to be sought. The principal compiler of the bibliography is Dr. Judith Tinnes. An earlier version of the first part of this Research Report has been published as an ICCT Policy Brief in October 2015.",
        "The media products of the revolutionary movement known as the Islamic State (also IS, ISIL, ISIS, Daesh) have received a significant amount of attention from analysts and journalists alike. While extremely helpful, most of this effort is focused at performing content analysis of fairly recent products. As part of the Counter-Terrorism Strategic Communication (CTSC) project’s effort to better understand propaganda messaging in the 21st century, the author of this Research Paper examined primary documents and other media published by the Islamic State movement during its entire existence in order to develop a history of the media department since 2003. The framework for analysis focused on the interaction between key media leaders, the ever-expanding structure and institutions, and the process of innovation used to experiment with different media techniques in different phases of the group’s evolution. Based on this history, the paper presents six observations about the media department and its role in the larger movement – in the hopes that this knowledge will be helpful in efforts to combat this particular group and its inevitable imitators in the future.",
        "France ranks first in the EU as a provider of foreign terrorist fighters in Syria and Iraq, and as the most-targeted European country in the context of the Syrian-Iraqi conflict. France has a longstanding history related to jihadism, correlated with multiple grievances from jihadist groups: it has been depicted as an enemy of Islam because of its foreign policy, its domestic policy towards religion, and, last but not least, its very essence. These grievances have been conveyed, like the baton of a relay race, from the first generations of North-African Islamist networks and the “elder brothers of jihad” to contemporary jihadists. The French jihadist media ecosystem has been instrumental in attracting a particularly large contemporary following. From the French perspective, a range of social, cultural, religious, economic, political, demographic drivers and identity factors converged to create a fertile ground for receptive radicals to emerge and break away from democratic values. Informed by these issues, this Policy Brief aims to identify avenues of further development for the French counter-terrorism strategic communication strategy. It concludes by stressing the need for this communication strategy to strive for positive, alternative messaging to re-create a continuum between individuals in the jihadist milieu and France as a nation state.",
        "In this Research Paper, Former Visiting Fellow Akinola Olojo examines the key drivers of public support for Boko Haram in northern Nigeria. The author suggests that the effective formulation and implementation of a proactive (Nigerian) counter-terrorism strategy requires an incisive understanding of the political, socio-economic and religious/ideological drivers of public support for the group. The multi-dimensional nature of the Boko Haram crisis in northern Nigeria challenges conventional approaches used in addressing terrorist violence. Olojo reflects on the need for a bold mix of interventions and partnerships that combine elements of both hard and soft power. The application of these approaches by both domestic actors and external partners must necessarily draw upon an understanding of the key drivers that this Paper explores.",
        "With the outbreak of civil war and sectarian violence in Syria, Iraq, and Libya, over 15,000 men and women from more than 80 countries around the world have left their homes to become foreign fighters. The security challenge they pose is immense and there are concerns about radicalised fighters returning to their countries of origin or residence, hardened by experience and with the possible intent – and the know-how – to engage in terrorist activities.\r\n\r\nOn 24 September, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2178 (2014) with the support of over 120 states representing a broad cross-section of the UN membership. Resolution 2178 called on all UN member states to ensure increased border security and to screen for or arrest so-called “foreign terrorist fighters” (FTFs) travelling to or returning from conflict areas. Rightly so, it also urges states to counter violent extremism by taking preventive measures, such as engaging with communities at the local level to stop the spread of extremist ideologies.\r\n\r\nOn 23 October 2014, the Global Center on Cooperative Security, the Human Security Collective, and ICCT convened an expert meeting at the European Union (EU) in Brussels to discuss the implications of the resolution and to explore appropriate and effective responses to the threat of FTFs, both within the EU and as part of the Union’s foreign security and development programming.\r\n\r\nBuilding upon the discussion in Brussels, this policy brief is a compilation of essays from all three organisations on the challenges and opportunities for addressing the FTF threat from a European Union perspective. It also examines the implementation of Resolution 2178 as an integral part of national and multilateral foreign security and development policies and initiatives.",
        "In March 2012, Prof. Dr. Rohan Gunaratna interviewed Umar Patek and Ali Imron, both of whom have admitted involvement in the two bomb attacks in Bali in October 2002 which killed over 200 people. This ICCT Research Paper explores violent extremist “narratives” within the Indonesian context by interviewing a convicted terrorist (Ali Imron) and one currently undergoing trial (Umar Patek). It is hoped that by understanding and de-constructing those emotional stories or ideologies that are often told and used to justify violence, or to motivate someone to commit violence, in pursuit of a cause; that the policy making community can then counter these narratives more effectively. This Paper first explores the background of violent extremist narratives and then recounts and analyses the Patek and Imron interviews. Based on these interviews and current knowledge of violent extremist narratives, the paper concludes with a series of recommendations.",
        "Since 9/11, the state of the art in counter-terrorism research, counter-terorism measures and counter-terrorism impacts has taken off. Nevertheless, countering terrorism as a branch of fear management is still a discipline to be developed. In this Research Paper, authors Prof. Dr. Edwin Bakker and Prof. Dr. Beatrice de Graaf attempt to lessen this gap. The Paper identifies and analyses governmental approaches to managing fear in relation to terrorist incidents. It is a stocktaking approach, offering a preliminary oversight of some central aspects and pointers on the way forward when constructing and testing such a theory.",

        "This Policy Brief – a short version of a larger Research Paper to be released by ICCT in late 2015 – focuses on the phenomenon of foreign (terrorist) fighters (FTFs) as it relates to Syria and Iraq. It concentrates on recruits to jihad and the astonishing growth in numbers from less than 1,000 in 2011 to more than 3,500 in 2012, 8,500+ in 2013, 18,000+ in 2014 to more than 25,000 by fall 2015. By October 2015, nearly 30,000 militants from more than 100 countries had become foreign fighters with the so-called “Islamic State” (IS) in Syria and Iraq and other militant groups. This Policy Brief first discusses various definitions of FTFs by disaggregating the “foreign”, “terrorist” and “fighters” elements of FTFs of the UN Security Council definition in resolution 2178 (2014). Subsequently, an attempt is made to bring some structure and order to the widely diverging estimates of the numbers of foreign fighters and their origins, with tables presenting the best available estimates for different sides of the conflict at different moments in time since 2011. UN estimates on foreign fighters are juxtaposed with estimates from other sources. The biggest uncertainty is the ratio of foreign fighters to IS own core manpower. It is likely that at least 40 percent of the fighters of IS are foreigners and many more if Iraqis in Syria are counted as such.",
        "Converts to Islam represent a small percentage of the Muslim community in Western countries. Yet when it comes to Islamist extremism and terrorism, research has suggested that converts are considerably overrepresented. This ICCT Policy Brief serves as an introduction to this topic by providing an overview of what is known about converts’ involvement in homegrown jihadism and the foreign fighter phenomenon. Notwithstanding considerable reservations about the quantity and quality of the available data, this Policy Brief finds support for the notion of convert overrepresentation in these activities. This is especially so in the case of foreign fighters. What little data was found on converts’ involvement in homegrown jihadism provided a more nuanced picture, emphasizing that overrepresentation may not be the norm in all Western countries and that it may be a relatively recent development. Numerous explanations for converts’ involvement in Islamist extremism and terrorism have been provided, running the gamut from structural-level explanations to distinctly personal motives. At present, however, a comprehensive, theoretically sound and empirically grounded understanding of how and why converts become involved in Islamist militancy is absent. The Policy Brief concludes by stressing the need to develop our understanding of this important yet under-researched topic.",
        "Research on the engagement of children with the so-called Islamic State (a.k.a. ISIS) relies heavily on the analysis of obtained ISIS documents and ISIS-disseminated propaganda, leaving major elements of the recruitment and deployment process uncovered. Such ambiguities hinder future efforts aimed at dealing with ISIS’ child soldiers. As such, an intensive effort to compile data using interviews and naturalistic observations across ISIS-held territories in Syria was made to exhaustively explore the process of child recruitment and deployment by ISIS. Findings suggest that there are two methods of recruitment: predatory and structural. The enlistment, intensity of indoctrination, types of training, and nature of deployment were found to depend, to a high degree, on the type of recruitment (i.e., predatory or structural), and category of children based on their origin (i.e., local, Middle Eastern and North African [MENA], or foreign) and if they are orphans. The data shows that the separation between children and adults’ roles/assignments is diminishing. After a thorough exploration of the elements of ISIS’ recruitment and deployment process, this paper argues its findings, implications, and limitations.",

The outcomes of the Expert Meeting on this topic, that took place on 22 March 2011, have been incorporated in this paper.",
        "In this Research Paper, Research Fellow Dr. Alex P. Schmid seeks to clarify some conceptual issues that tend to obscure the debate about how best to counter violent extremism. The main focus of this Research Paper is on obtaining a clearer understanding of what “Islamist extremism” entails in the context of the ongoing debate on allegedly “acceptable” non-violent extremists and “unacceptable” violent extremists. The author discusses a number of conceptualisations of religious extremism in the context of liberal democracies and also distinguishes, inter alia, between merely “not (yet) violent” militancy and principled non-violent political activism in the Gandhian tradition. The author argues that the distinction between “non-violent extremism” and “violent extremism” is not a valid one. The paper provides a set of twenty indicators of extremism that can be used as an instrument for monitoring extremist statements and actions, with an eye to challenging and countering such non-democratic manifestations.",
        "The number of European foreign fighters with a jihadist political agenda participating in the Syrian civil war has increased exponentially over the past months and has become an ever-growing concern for European policymakers. It is particularly the possibility that returned foreign fighters have radicalised that makes them a potential threat – if only to themselves and their direct surroundings. In this Research Paper, Edwin Bakker, Christophe Paulussen and Eva Entenmann examine some of the challenges, as well as possible strategies and legal mechanisms available for European policymakers to address the foreign fighters phenomenon. It first assesses the complex threat (potentially) posed by returning mujahidin to Europe’s security. The Research Paper then outlines some of the risk assessment and governance challenges that European policymakers, governments and legal practitioners face in relation to (potential) foreign jihadi fighters and returnees. Prosecution via international crimes will be analysed before turning to specific national practices. Here, the Research Paper focuses on a few European states that have a considerable number of departing foreign fighters as estimated by their own intelligence services: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and the UK. The Research Paper concludes with a series of recommendations.",
        "This Research Paper aims to analyse in depth the global propaganda strategy of the so-called “Islamic State” (IS) by looking at the methods through which this grand strategy is carried out as well as the objectives that IS wants to achieve through it. The authors first discuss IS’ growth model, explaining why global expansion and recruitment of foreign fighters are pivotal to IS success. Having in mind this critical role, the authors then explore the narratives and themes used by the group to mobilise foreign fighters and jihadists groups. Third, the paper analyses how IS deploys its narratives in those territories where it has established a foothold. Fourth, it outlines IS’ direct engagement strategy and how it is used to facilitate allegiance of other jihadist groups. The final section of the paper offers a menu of policy options that stakeholders can implement to counter IS’ global propaganda efforts.",
        "There is an assertion that the participation of foreign banks in emerging markets is often thought to improve overall bank soundness. Therefore, if the share of foreign banks in a national banking system is large, the system will quickly overcome both financial or currency crises, and quickly recover itself. Since Turkey has been experienced mentioned crises, the aim of this study is to reveal if the assertion is valid for Turkey. Our expectation from the study using VAR method is to reach a conclusion that countries with large market share of foreign banks have safely passed the crises by virtue of foreign banks best management policies. The test results indicate that foreign banks have more positive effect for helping TBS capital structure; foreign bank participation did not cause any decline in loans and last one, after crisis, existence of foreign banks worsens TBS liquidity in interest and exchange rate shocks.",

In the modern world-system an analogous process takes the form of the rise and fall of hegemonic core powers, and the arena of contention became global in scope during the 19th century (c.e.). The studies here are of three di?erent and largely separate regional world-systems during di?erent time periods. All three focus on state formation, empire building and collapse.",
        "Republic of Macedonia is an entity described as cultural mosaic, with strong multiethnic and multi-confessional basis, it is a point where East and West meet, it is well-known for the system of Macedonian salad. But, this society even after 25 year of social transition and 2001 Ohrid Agreement did not achieve to find the way of conclusive peace, stability and social eudemonia. The diversity is issue that from time to time produces turbulences, especially at the line of two main identity groups Macedonians-Christian Orthodox and Albanians-Muslim community.\n\nQuantitative data in this study were obtained on a sample of 219 young adults from Skopje (95 of Macedonian and 17 of Albanian ethnicity) and Tetovo (76 of Albanian and 31 of Macedonian ethnicity), aged from 18 to 35 years (M = 24.85, SD = 3.2). Main research question is that if there exist differences between young Macedonians and Albanians in their ethnic, religious and national identity? The objective of this paper is to give a scientific picture how categories as gender, marriage, family, ethnicity, religion, living place, Balkan, Europe are perceived by the youth, all this in favour of using them in producing affirmative actions, more productive societal policies and constructive society-building. Multiple social identities: their complexity and inclusiveness, the correlation of identity variables with SII and SIC are among issues analyzed in this paper. National dominance was more frequent among Macedonians. Our findings demonstrate that Albanian participants expressed strong social identity, as Albanians and as being Muslims. Only social identity inclusiveness is significantly related to societal and political attitudes, but ethnicity should be taken into consideration when this relationship is explored.",
        "This article examines the role of the world-system in the structure of cities. Data from the evolution of cities in the Fertile Crescent shows that a number of traits of modern cities were also present in the earliest cities. Specifically, mass production, social differentiation and inequality, cultural mechanisms utilized for social control, and a tendency  even a need  for territorial expansion were all characteristic of ancient cities. Such characteristics of cities are rooted in the process of urbanization, understood here as the creation and maintenance of networks of economic and cultural exchange amongst communities in disparate regions. Citiesare understood as nodes in this system of exchange. It is argued that urbanization predatescities by thousands of years, and that the social dynamics arising from urbanization must be teased out of the data in order to understand cities better.",
        "Privatization is considered an initial step toward market economy, restructuring financial and economic sector that enables competition in the economy. Privatization is the most painful process in economy where beside legal establishment and political will, it includes also the aspect of fairness and honesty. Analysis of this process is based on the models and comparisons between Kosovo and countries of central and Eastern Europe, in order to give a clearer picture on the overall process of privatization in Kosovo\n\nMethodology that is used to analyze this issue is based on empirical results and also qualitative interpretation of the models and also on studying particular asset privatization process. A widely discussed case of privatization in Kosovo is that of Post and Telecom of Kosovo (PTK). Since each company has its own value, I have focused my appraising analysis on the financial statements with a special observation on Cash Flow from Operation, as the most significant indicator on showing how company is using her physical and human recourses to generate money. I have based my research on using methodology of discounted cash flow from operation analysis, even though the company valuation was done using net cash flow from operation analysis. Cash Flow valuation then was discounted by the T-bonds interest rate.\n\nThis paper tries to bring a conclusion that privatization process in Kosovo have not brought the results excepted, firstly by setting an inappropriate price of assets and lastly by restructuring overall privatization sector and the overall industry. Kosovo, consequently, lost a big opportunity to create a competitive environment of financial industry: starting from the banking industry followed the pension trust which remained at their initial steps of development",
        "The attacks of September 11 are explored from the perspective of three temporalitiesthat of US hegemony (roughly the last 50 years), that of the history of modernity (roughly the last three hundred and ?fty years) and that of the clash between Western and nonWestern civilizations (roughly the last one thousand years). The attacks are symptomatic of the emergence of regional, networked actors that the US is not well prepared to address and which disrupt the nationaldevelopmental world order organized under US hegemony. By demonstrating one of the unintended consequences of modernitythe democratization of means of destructionthe attacks mark another nail in the co?n of the idea that progress can be attained through technological breakthroughs and the rational organization of the world (which we call hegemonic rationalistic modernity). The attempt to galvanize the Islamic community through an assault on its perceived rivals parallels the strategy of the Christian crusades 1000 years ago. The attacks mark a moment in the declining ability of the West to control the nonWestern world. In conclusion, world order is likely to be reconstructed only if there is a move beyond US hegemony, rationalistic modernity, and the presumption of Western supremacy that characterize the contemporary world.",

My thanks to Andrew Jorgenson, co-editor of JWSR, who moderated the session and proposed that I put together a special issue on this topic. In turn, I asked Timothy Moran to join me as co-editor of this issue. Tim is one of the foremost quantitative macro-comparative sociologists in the country, and was the discussant on the PEWS panel. Tim provides a summary and discussion of the contributions in the conclusion. As it turns out, only two of the panel presentations are included in this issue. The other two were submitted in response to a general call for papers. All four manuscripts were peer reviewed.",

Consistent with analysis of Indic system data, there is no support for the theory that the normal world-system power configuration is multipolar, hegemonic, or universal-empire. Instead several different \"stability epochs\" are discerned.",
        "The coming into existence of the capitalist world-economy created new constraints on utilizingthe land for productive purposes. The single most important change is that it established asystematic legal basis for what is called title to the land. Title to the land is fundamentally apolitical question masked by a legal veneer.  The amount of land that is governed by title is, eventoday, not 100% of the global land surface. But it has grown as a percentage of the total globalland surface throughout the history of the modern world-system. Population growth has led totwo forms of expansion. There is extensive growth, the bringing of more and more land areasinto the system of titled land. But there is also intensive growth, the ever greater concentration ofthe population of the world into close-contact areas. We call this urbanization. The world leftfaces a fundamental dilemma. On the one hand, the world left has stood for measures that wouldreduce the enormous real north-south gap. On the other hand, the world left (or at least agrowing portion of it) is standing against further commodification of land rights and furtherecological degradation of the world. The two strategies are contradictory and incompatible onewith the other. Land rights stand as the crucial deciding point.",
        "The goal of this study is to deal with some ethical causes in the public administration, that aim the avoidance of negative phenomenon’s as theft, corruption, etc. In this direction, the debates about ethics are becoming more and more a global tendency, as an implement through which would be found the way to get out of the crisis. The success in the reforms of the public administrations in major part depends, on the public functionaries and their willingness to make fundamental changes in the way they work. In this direction, the State should strengthen and modernize the public service, should realize an employment system, which should reflect more the merits on its service.\n\nFor this reason, the government’s attempts should be concentrated on the construction of a positive image for the state and its administration as professional objective, which is oriented to the services. Being aware for the practical restrictions of this study, we firstly chose to concentrate on the local public administrations ethics. The study will be focused on the practical comparative analysis of the city of Shkodra and Durres by the realization of a questionnaire by each of these municipalities and the Agency of Legalization and Urbanization of Informal Zones (ALUIZNI) in Shkodra.",

        "Recently there are many authors that have studied and analyzed the impact of foreign direct investments (FDI) on the export performance. They have different opinions about the effect of foreign direct investments on the export performance. Some of them in their papers conclude that FDI have positive effect on the export performance and some not. There are also findings that FDI do not have any impact on the export performance. Of course for economic benefit of host country it is not important only the amount of FDI, but also their structure. To measure the effect of FDI on the export performance is not easy.\n\nTherefore, the main objective of this paper is to analyze empirically the foreign direct investments and exports performance during the period of 1996-2013 in Western Balkan countries. The paper also investigates for the fixed effects and individual heterogeneity across countries and years. Based on the panel regression techniques and Least Square Dummy Variable (LSDV) regression method, FDI positively affect export performance in the sample countries in various model specifications.\n\nThe results and conclusions of this paper we hope that will help everybody who are interested and studying this matter, especially the policy makers.  The last ones have the obligation to facilitate and promote the export if they award confirm that FDI contribute on developing their economy.",

        "Centrality in the world-system allows countries to externalize their hazards or environmental harms on others. Core countries, for instance, dump heavy metals and greenhouse gases into the global sinks, and some of the core's hazardous products, production processes and wastes are displaced to the (semi) peripheral zones of the world-system. Since few (semi) peripheral countries have the ability to assess and manage the risks associated with such hazards, the transfer of core hazards to the (semi) periphery has adverse environmental and socio-economic consequences for many of these countries and it has spawned conflict and resistance, as well as a variety of other responses. Most discussions of this risk globalization problem have failed to situate it firmly in the world-system frame emphasizing the process of ecological unequal exchange. Using secondary sources, I begin such a discussion by examining the specific problem of ship breaking (recycling core-based ocean going vessels for steel and other materials) at the yards in Alang-Sosiya, India and Chittagong, Bangladesh. Attention centers on the nature and scope of ship breaking in these two locations, major drivers operating in the world-system, adverse consequences, the unequal mix of costs and benefits, and the failure of existing political responses at the domestic and international levels to reduce adequately the adverse consequences of ship breaking.",
        "With the end of the Cold War, much attention has been paid to the nature of the emerging new world order. By what criteria will power and influence be measured in this new era? Who will be the winners and losers? What types of allegiances will develop? Or is Francis Fukuyama's argument correct that, with the collapse of communism, we have reached the \"...endpoint of man's ideological evolution\" and thus \"the end of history\". Unlike Marx, who saw socialism at the end of humanity's arduous journey, Fukuyama tells us that the search is off because we have already arrived at our evolutionary destination: liberal capitalism...Other analysts envision less optimistic scenarios...One of the most popular scenarios over the past few years has been to anticipate growing tensions between the three main core powers: the US, Germany, and Japan... The first task of this paper, then, is to look at Germany within the context of the radically altered post-Cold War period... We argue that Germany, based on a multitude of factors which will be outlined below, is not now, nor will it ever become in the foreseeable future, a global hegemon... Indeed, as will be asserted in the second part of this paper, Germany will enter into a close alliance with the United States to form a reinvigorated trans-Atlantic marriage in which the common bonds of \"culture and civilization\" will replace a virulent anti-communism as the common vow.",

        "This article provides a definition of racism inspired in the work of Frantz Fanon, Boaventura de Sousa Santos and contemporary Caribbean Fanonian Philosophers. It discusses racism in relation to zone of being and zone of non-being. Racism is discussed as a dehumanization related to the materiality of domination used by the world-system in the zone of non-being (violence and dispossession) as opposed to the materiality of domination in the zone of being (regulation and emancipation). The approach shows how intersectionality of oppressions work differently for oppressed people in the zone of being as opposed to oppressed people in the zone of non-being. While in the zone of being oppressions are mitigated by racial privilege, in the zone of non-being oppressions are aggravated by racial oppression.",
        "This paper examines how different power strategies have been playedover the course of the three-thousand year Andean civilization. In broad terms, the power strategies center on ideological, economic, and military power (Mann 1986; Earle 1997). The case materials show that what we call states are formations that succeed, albeit temporarily, in combining strat-egies of ideological, economic, and military power. Nonetheless, following Randall Collins (1981:71), I would argue that coercive power is the sine qua non for state development. If we start from the power to coerce as a foun-dation, varying strategies of manipulating economic, ideological, and military power will produce a number of different pathways to varying forms of organization. Some may be more centralized than others, some may be less steeply strati?ed than others, some may have more specialized institutions than others, some may look more like environmental management systems, and others may look more like well-organized predatory protection rackets. Those which were less successful in manipulating these strategies were more vulnerable to collapse, opening the way for new formations to emerge. As world-systems approaches would predict, this has often happened on the peripheries of former core formations.",

        "The advertisement is a form of marketing communication which is used to encourage, convince or manipulate an audience (the viewers, listeners or readers, sometimes a special group) to take or to continue taking some actions. Advertisements have an important role in increasing sales. Successful ads that result with the growth of sales require competent personnel including a number of specialists; therefore it is very necessary to choose the personnel carefully, to ensure firms a stable position in the market. Advertisement costs are quite large, but they have to be in accordance with the growth of sales. From the collected and analyzed data, we can conclude that kosovar businesses pay great attention to advertisements and share their budget for them. In this paper, the importance of advertisements in sales growth is explained, as well as how many ads do they do, how much budget do they share for this, for which kinds of media do they share more budget and what obstacles they encounter during the advertising. The paper consists of two parts: the part of literature review that is connected to the topic and the research part. Primary data was used for the realization of the paper, which was obtained through questionnaires by direct contact with the general managers, marketing managers, directors and owners with a wide knowledge about advertisements in enterprises. For the realization of this paper, quantitative methods were used.",
        "Experiments using P2X3 knock-out mice or more general P2X receptor antagonists suggest that P2X3 receptors contribute to visceral hypersensitivity. We aimed to investigate the effect of the selective P2X3 antagonist A-317491 on visceral sensitivity under physiological conditions, during acute colitis and in the post-inflammatory phase of colitis.Trinitrobenzene sulphonic-acid colitis was monitored by colonoscopy: on day 3 to confirm the presence of colitis and then every 4 days, starting from day 10, to monitor convalescence and determine the exact timepoint of endoscopic healing in each rat. Visceral sensitivity was assessed by quantifying visceromotor responses to colorectal distension in controls, rats with acute colitis and post-colitis rats. A-317491 was administered 30 min prior to visceral sensitivity testing. Expression of P2X3 receptors (RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry) and the intracellular signalling molecules cdk5, csk and CASK (RT-PCR) were quantified in colonic tissue and dorsal root ganglia. ATP release in response to colorectal distension was measured by luminiscence.Rats with acute TNBS-colitis displayed significant visceral hypersensitivity that was dose-dependently, but not fully, reversed by A-317491. Hypersenstivity was accompanied by an increased colonic release of ATP. Post-colitis rats also displayed visceral hypersensitivity that was dose-dependently reduced and fully normalized by A-317491 without increased release of ATP. A-317491 did not modify visceral sensitivity in controls. P2X3 mRNA and protein expression in the colon and dorsal root ganglia were similar in control, acute colitis and post-colitis groups, while colonic mRNA expression of cdk5, csk and CASK was increased in the post-colitis group only.These findings indicate that P2X3 receptors are not involved in sensory signaling under physiological conditions whereas they modulate visceral hypersensitivity during acute TNBS-colitis and even more so in the post-inflammatory phase, albeit via different mechanisms of sensitization, validating P2X3 receptors as potential new targets in the treatment of abdominal pain syndromes.",
        "The bioaccumulation and biomagnification of mercury (Hg) and selenium (Se) were investigated in sub-tropical freshwater food webs from Burkina Faso, West Africa, a region where very few ecosystem studies on contaminants have been performed. During the 2010 rainy season, samples of water, sediment, fish, zooplankton, and mollusks were collected from three water reservoirs and analysed for total Hg (THg), methylmercury (MeHg), and total Se (TSe). Ratios of δ13C and δ15N were measured to determine food web structures and patterns of contaminant accumulation and transfer to fish. Food chain lengths (FCLs) were calculated using mean δ15N of all primary consumer taxa collected as the site-specific baseline. We report relatively low concentrations of THg and TSe in most fish. We also found in all studied reservoirs short food chain lengths, ranging from 3.3 to 3.7, with most fish relying on a mixture of pelagic and littoral sources for their diet. Mercury was biomagnified in fish food webs with an enrichment factor ranging from 2.9 to 6.5 for THg and from 2.9 to 6.6 for MeHg. However, there was no evidence of selenium biomagnification in these food webs. An inverse relationship was observed between adjusted δ15N and log-transformed Se:Hg ratios, indicating that Se has a lesser protective effect in top predators, which are also the most contaminated animals with respect to MeHg. Trophic position, carbon source, and fish total length were the factors best explaining Hg concentration in fish. In a broader comparison of our study sites with literature data for other African lakes, the THg biomagnification rate was positively correlated with FCL. We conclude that these reservoir systems from tropical Western Africa have low Hg biomagnification associated with short food chains. This finding may partly explain low concentrations of Hg commonly reported in fish from this area.",
        "Unconscious mental processes have recently started gaining attention in a number of scientific disciplines. One of the theoretical frameworks for describing unconscious processes was introduced by Jung as a part of his model of the psyche. This framework uses the concept of archetypes that represent prototypical experiences associated with objects, people, and situations. Although the validity of Jungian model remains an open question, this framework is convenient from the practical point of view. Moreover, archetypes found numerous applications in the areas of psychology and marketing. Therefore, observation of both conscious and unconscious traces related to archetypal experiences seems to be an interesting research endeavor. In a study with 36 subjects, we examined the effects of experiencing conglomerations of unconscious emotions associated with various archetypes on the participants' introspective reports and patterns of physiological activations. Our hypothesis for this experiment was that physiological data may predict archetypes more precisely than introspective reports due to the implicit nature of archetypal experiences. Introspective reports were collected using the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) technique. Physiological measures included cardiovascular, electrodermal, respiratory responses and skin temperature of the subjects. The subjects were stimulated to feel four archetypal experiences and four explicit emotions by means of film clips. The data related to the explicit emotions served as a reference in analysis of archetypal experiences. Our findings indicated that while prediction models trained on the collected physiological data could recognize the archetypal experiences with accuracy of 55 percent, similar models built based on the SAM data demonstrated performance of only 33 percent. Statistical tests enabled us to confirm that physiological observations are better suited for observation of implicit psychological constructs like archetypes than introspective reports.",
        "It is thought that a large amount of albumin leaking from the glomerulus in nephrotic syndrome (NS) is reabsorbed at the proximal tubule and catabolized. Therefore, it is possible the final quantity of urinary protein does not always reflect the amount of leakage of protein from the glomerulus. We experienced two cases without nephrotic range proteinuria thought to involve hypoproteinemia due to the same pathophysiology as NS. On these patients, we performed protein leakage scintigraphy with technetium-99m human serum albumin diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (99mTc-HSAD) to exclude a diagnosis of protein-losing gastroenteropathy and observed diffuse positive accumulation in the kidneys with more intense uptake in the kidney than the liver on the anterior view 24 hours after 99mTc-HSAD administration. In healthy adults intravenously given 99mTc-HSAD, the same dynamics are observed as in albumin metabolism, and the organ radioactivity of the liver and kidneys after 24 hours is equal. Therefore, we thought it was possible that the renal uptake 24 hours after 99mTc-HSAD administration was a characteristic finding of NS. In order to confirm it, the subjects were divided into two groups: the NS group (n = 10) and the non-NS group (n = 7). We defined more intense uptake in the kidney than the liver on the anterior view 24 hours after 99mTc-HSAD administration as Dense Kidney (+). Furthermore, we designed regions of interest in the right and left kidneys and liver on anterior and posterior images, then calculated the kidney-liver ratio. Nine of the ten patients had Dense Kidney (+) in the NS group, compared to none in the non-NS group. And the kidney-liver ratio was significantly higher in the NS group than in the non-NS group on each view in the bilateral kidneys. In conclusion, our results suggest that the renal uptake 24 hours after 99mTc-HSAD administration is a characteristic finding of NS.",
        "Small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) may be useful for conducting high-precision, low-disturbance waterbird surveys, but limited data exist on their effectiveness. We evaluated the capacity of a small UAS to census a large (>6,000 nests) coastal Common tern (Sterna hirundo) colony of which ground surveys are particularly disruptive and time-consuming. We compared aerial photographic tern counts to ground nest counts in 45 plots (5-m radius) throughout the colony at three intervals over a nine-day period in order to identify sources of variation and establish a coefficient to estimate nest numbers from UAS surveys. We also compared a full colony ground count to full counts from two UAS surveys conducted the following day. Finally, we compared colony disturbance levels over the course of UAS flights to matched control periods. Linear regressions between aerial and ground counts in plots had very strong correlations in all three comparison periods (R2 = 0.972-0.989, P < 0.001) and regression coefficients ranged from 0.928-0.977 terns/nest. Full colony aerial counts were 93.6% and 94.0%, respectively, of the ground count. Varying visibility of terns with ground cover, weather conditions and image quality, and changing nest attendance rates throughout incubation were likely sources of variation in aerial detection rates. Optimally timed UAS surveys of Common tern colonies following our method should yield population estimates in the 93-96% range of ground counts. Although the terns were initially disturbed by the UAS flying overhead, they rapidly habituated to it. Overall, we found no evidence of sustained disturbance to the colony by the UAS. We encourage colonial waterbird researchers and managers to consider taking advantage of this burgeoning technology.",
        "Questionnaire studies suggest that hearing is declining among young adults. However, few studies have examined the reliability of hearing questionnaires among young adult subjects. This study examined the associations between pure tone audiometrically assessed (PTA) hearing loss and questionnaire responses in young to middle aged adults.A cross-sectional study using questionnaire and screening PTA (500 through 6000 Hz) data from 15322 Swedish subjects (62% women) aged 18 through 50 years. PTA hearing loss was defined as a hearing threshold above 20 dB in both ears at one or more frequencies. Data were analysed with chi-square tests, nonlinear regression, binary logistic regression, and the generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach.The prevalence of PTA hearing loss was 6.0% in men and 2.9% in women (p < 0.001). Slight hearing impairment was reported by 18.5% of the men and 14.8% of the women (p < 0.001), whereas 0.5% of men and women reported very impaired hearing. Using multivariate GEE modelling, the odds ratio of PTA hearing loss was 30.4 (95% CI, 12.7-72.9) in men and 36.5 (17.2-77.3) in women reporting very impaired hearing. The corresponding figures in those reporting slightly impaired hearing were 7.06 (5.25-9.49) in men and 8.99 (6.38-12.7) in women. These values depended on the sound stimulus frequency (p = 0.001). The area under the ROC curve was 0.904 (0.892-0.915) in men and 0.886 (0.872-0.900) in women.Subjective hearing impairment predicted clinically assessed hearing loss, suggesting that there is cause for concern as regards the future development of hearing in young to middle-aged people.",
        "To evaluate differences among poplar clones of various ploidies, 12 hybrid poplar clones (P. simonii × P. nigra) × (P. nigra × P. simonii) with different ploidies were used to study phenotypic variation in growth traits and photosynthetic characteristics. Analysis of variance showed remarkable differences for each of the investigated traits among these clones (P < 0.01). Coefficients of phenotypic variation (PCV) ranged from 2.38% to 56.71%, and repeatability ranged from 0.656 to 0.987. The Pn (photosynthetic rate) photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) curves of the 12 clones were S-shaped, but the Pn-ambient CO2 (Ca) curves were shaped like an inverted \"V\". The stomatal conductance (Gs)-PPFD and transpiration rate (Tr)-PPFD curves had an upward tendency; however, with increasing PFFD, the intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci)-PPFD curves had a downward tendency in all of the clones. The Pn-PPFD and Pn-Ca curves followed the pattern of a quadratic equation. The average light saturation point and light compensation point of the triploid clones were the highest and lowest, respectively, among the three types of clones. For Pn-Ca curves, diploid clones had a higher average CO2 saturation point and average CO2 compensation point compared with triploid and tetraploid clones. Correlation analyses indicated that all investigated traits were strongly correlated with each other. In future studies, molecular methods should be used to analyze poplar clones of different ploidies to improve our understanding of the growth and development mechanisms of polyploidy.",
        "During a citywide epidemic of serogroup C meningococcal disease in Salvador in 2010, Brazil, the state government initiated mass vaccination targeting two age groups with high attack rates: individuals aged <5 years and 10-24 years. More than 600,000 doses of meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccines were administered. We performed a case-control study to evaluate vaccine uptake, document vaccine effectiveness and identify reasons for non-vaccination.Population-based surveillance identified patients with laboratory-confirmed invasive meningococcal C (MenC) disease during 2010. Information on MenC vaccination was obtained from case patients and age-matched individuals from the same neighborhoods. MenC vaccine effectiveness was estimated based on the exact odds ratios obtained by conditional logistic regression analysis. Of 51 laboratory-confirmed cases of serogroup C meningococcal disease among patients <5 and 10-24 years of age 50 were included in the study and matched with 240 controls. Overall case-fatality was 25%. MenC vaccine coverage among controls increased from 7.1% to 70.2% after initiation of the vaccination campaign. None of the 50 case patients but 70 (29.2%) of the 240 control individuals, including 59 (70.2%) of 84 matched with cases from the period after MenC vaccination, had received at least one MenC vaccine dose. Overall effectiveness of MenC was 98% with a lower 95% exact confidence limit of 89%.MenC vaccines administered during the meningococcal epidemic were highly effective, suggesting that rapid vaccine uptake through campaigns contributed to control of meningococcal disease.",
        "Population-based HIV surveillance is crucial to inform understanding of the HIV pandemic and evaluate HIV interventions, but little is known about longitudinal participation patterns in such settings. We investigated the dynamics of longitudinal participation patterns in a high HIV prevalence surveillance setting in rural South Africa between 2003 and 2012, taking into account demographic dynamics. At any given survey round, 22,708 to 30,495 persons were eligible. Although the yearly participation rates were relatively modest (26% to 46%), cumulative rates increased substantially with multiple recruitment opportunities: 68% of eligible persons participated at least once, 48% at least twice and 31% at least three times after five survey rounds. We identified two types of study fatigue: at the individual level, contact and consent rates decreased with multiple recruitment opportunities and, at the population level, these rates also decreased over calendar time, independently of multiple recruitment opportunities. Using sequence analysis and hierarchical clustering, we identified three broad individual participation profiles: consenters (20%), switchers (43%) and refusers (37%). Men were over represented among refusers, women among consenters, and temporary non-residents among switchers. The specific subgroup of persons who were systemically not contacted or refusers constitutes a challenge for population-based surveillance and interventions.",
        "Four experiments examined the ability of respondents to identify letters that were displayed on an LED array with flashes lasting little more than a microsecond. The first experiment displayed each letter with a single, simultaneous flash of all the dots forming the letter and established the relation of flash intensity to the probability of letter identification. The second experiment displayed the letters with multiple flashes at different frequencies to determine the probability that the sequence of flashes would be perceived as fused. The third experiment displayed the letters at a frequency that was above the flicker-fusion frequency, varying flash intensity to establish the amount needed to elicit a given probability of letter identification. The fourth experiment displayed each letter twice, once at a frequency where no flicker was perceived and also with steady light emission. The intensity of each flash was fixed and the steady intensity was varied; respondents were asked to judge whether the fused-flicker display and the steady display appeared to be the same brightness. Steady intensity was about double the average flash intensity where the two conditions were perceived as being equal in brightness. This is at odds with Talbot-Plateau law, which predicts that these two values should be equal. The law was formulated relative to a flash lasting half of each period, so it is surprising that it comes this close to being correct where the flash occupies only a millionth of the total period.",
        "Dysregulated Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) signalling and genetic polymorphisms in these proteins are linked to many human diseases. We investigated TLR4 functional variants D299G and T399I to assess the impact on LPS-induced responsiveness in comparison to wild-type TLR4. The mechanism by which this occurs in unclear as these SNPs do not lie within the lipid A binding domain or dimerisation sites of the LPS-TLR4/MD2 receptor complexes. Transfection of TLR4D299G, TLR4T399I or TLR4D299G. T399I into HEK cells resulted in constitutive activation of an NF-κB reporter gene and a blunting of the LPS-induced reporter activation compared to WT-TLR4. Unstimulated human monocyte/macrophages, from patients with the D299G and T399I SNPs demonstrated a downregulation of many genes, particularly Tram/Trif signalling pathway constitutents compared to the TLR4 wild-type subjects supporting the concept of basal receptor activity. Monocyte/macrophages from carriers of the TLR4 D299G and T399I polymorphisms stimulated with LPS showed >6 fold lower levels of NF-κB and ∼12 fold higher IFN-β gene expression levels compared to wild-type subjects (P<0.05; MWU test) and dramatically altered resultant cytokine profiles. We conclude that these TLR4 SNPs affect constitutive receptor activity which impacts on the hosts ability to respond to LPS challenge leading to a dysregulated sub-optimal immune response to infection.",
        "Despite recent breakthroughs in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic within South Africa, the transmission of the virus continues at alarmingly high rates. It is possible, with the use of phylogenetic methods, to uncover transmission events of HIV amongst local communities in order to identify factors that may contribute to the sustained transmission of the virus. The aim of this study was to uncover transmission events of HIV amongst the infected population of Cape Town.We analysed gag p24 and RT-pol sequences which were generated from samples spanning over 21-years with advanced phylogenetic techniques. We identified two transmission clusters over a 21-year period amongst randomly sampled patients from Cape Town and the surrounding areas. We also estimated the origin of each of the identified transmission clusters with the oldest cluster dating back, on average, 30 years and the youngest dating back roughly 20 years.These transmission clusters represent the first identified transmission events among the heterosexual population in Cape Town. By increasing the number of randomly sampled specimens within a dataset over time, it is possible to start to uncover transmission events of HIV amongst local communities in generalized epidemics. This information can be used to produce targeted interventions to decrease transmission of HIV in Africa.",
        "Maternal physical activity during pregnancy could alter offspring's IQ and neurodevelopment in childhood.Children belonging to a birth cohort were followed at 3, 12, 24 and 48 months of age. Physical activity during pregnancy was assessed retrospectively at birth. Neurodevelopment was evaluated by Battelle's Development Inventory (12, 24 and 48 months) and IQ by the Weschler's Intelligence Scale (48 months). Neurodevelopment was based on Battelles' (90th percentile) and also analyzed as a continuous outcome. IQ was analyzed as a continuous outcome. Potential confounders were: family income, mother's age, schooling, skin color, number of previous births and smoking; and newborns': preterm birth, sex and low birth weight.From birth to 48 months, sample size decreased from 4231 to 3792. Crude analysis showed that IQ at 48 months was slightly higher (5 points) among children from active women. The Battelle's score at 12 and 24 months was higher among offspring from active mothers. After controlling for confounders, physical activity during pregnancy was positively associated to the Battelle's Inventory at 12 months IQ, however, at 48 months no association was observed.Physical activity during pregnancy does not seem to impair children's neurodevelopment and children from active mothers presented better performance at 12 months.",
        "Deficiencies of vitamin A and iron affect a significant portion of the world's population, and efforts to characterize patterns of these deficiencies are hampered by a lack of measurement tools appropriate for large-scale population-based surveys. Vitamin A and iron are not easily measured directly, so reliable proxy markers for deficiency status have been identified and adopted. Measurement of inflammatory markers is necessary to interpret vitamin A and iron status markers, because circulating levels are altered by inflammation. We developed a multiplex immunoassay method for simultaneous measurement of five markers relevant to assessing inflammation, vitamin A and iron status: α-1-acid glycoprotein, C-reactive protein, retinol binding protein 4, ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor. Serum and plasma specimens were used to optimize the assay protocol. To evaluate assay performance, plasma from 72 volunteers was assayed using the multiplex technique and compared to conventional immunoassay methods for each of the five markers. Results of the new and conventional assay methods were highly correlated (Pearson Correlations of 0.606 to 0.991, p<.0001). Inter-assay imprecision for the multiplex panel varied from 1% to 8%, and all samples fell within the limits of quantification for all assays at a single dilution. Absolute values given by the multiplex and conventional assays differed, indicating a need for further work to devise a new standard curve. This multiplexed micronutrient immunoassay technique has excellent potential as a cost effective tool for use in large-scale deficiency assessment efforts.",
        "Genome wide association studies (GWAs) of breast cancer mortality have identified few potential associations. The concordance between these studies is unclear. In this study, we used a meta-analysis of two prognostic GWAs and a replication cohort to identify the strongest associations and to evaluate the loci suggested in previous studies. We attempt to identify those SNPs which could impact overall survival irrespective of the age of onset.To facilitate the meta-analysis and to refine the association signals, SNPs were imputed using data from the 1000 genomes project. Cox-proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) in 536 patients from the POSH cohort (Prospective study of Outcomes in Sporadic versus Hereditary breast cancer) and 805 patients from the HEBCS cohort (Helsinki Breast Cancer Study). These hazard ratios were combined using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effects meta-analysis and a p-value threshold of 5×10(-8) was used to determine significance. Replication was performed in 1523 additional patients from the POSH study.Although no SNPs achieved genome wide significance, three SNPs have significant association in the replication cohort and combined p-values less than 5.6×10(-6). These SNPs are; rs421379 which is 556 kb upstream of ARRDC3 (HR = 1.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.27-1.75, P = 1.1×10(-6)), rs12358475 which is between ECHDC3 and PROSER2 (HR = 0.75, CI = 0.67-0.85, P = 1.8×10(-6)), and rs1728400 which is between LINC00917 and FOXF1.In a genome wide meta-analysis of two independent cohorts from UK and Finland, we identified potential associations at three distinct loci. Phenotypic heterogeneity and relatively small sample sizes may explain the lack of genome wide significant findings. However, the replication at three SNPs in the validation cohort shows promise for future studies in larger cohorts. We did not find strong evidence for concordance between the few associations highlighted by previous GWAs of breast cancer survival and this study.",
        "Accurate and reliable quantification of the abundance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules, both wild-type and those harbouring pathogenic mutations, is important not only for understanding the progression of mtDNA disease but also for evaluating novel therapeutic approaches. A clear understanding of the sensitivity of mtDNA measurement assays under different experimental conditions is therefore critical, however it is routinely lacking for most published mtDNA quantification assays. Here, we comprehensively assess the variability of two quantitative Taqman real-time PCR assays, a widely-applied MT-ND1/MT-ND4 multiplex mtDNA deletion assay and a recently developed MT-ND1/B2M singleplex mtDNA copy number assay, across a range of DNA concentrations and mtDNA deletion/copy number levels. Uniquely, we provide a specific guide detailing necessary numbers of sample and real-time PCR plate replicates for accurately and consistently determining a given difference in mtDNA deletion levels and copy number in homogenate skeletal muscle DNA.",
        "Establishing the extent, geographical distribution and mechanisms of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors is a prerequisite for resistance management. Here, we report a widespread distribution of insecticide resistance in the major malaria vector An. funestus across Uganda and western Kenya under the control of metabolic resistance mechanisms.Female An. funestus collected throughout Uganda and western Kenya exhibited a Plasmodium infection rate between 4.2 to 10.4%. Widespread resistance against both type I (permethrin) and II (deltamethrin) pyrethroids and DDT was observed across Uganda and western Kenya. All populations remain highly susceptible to carbamate, organophosphate and dieldrin insecticides. Knockdown resistance plays no role in the pyrethroid and DDT resistance as no kdr mutation associated with resistance was detected despite the presence of a F1021C replacement. Additionally, no signature of selection was observed on the sodium channel gene. Synergist assays and qRT-PCR indicated that metabolic resistance plays a major role notably through elevated expression of cytochrome P450s. DDT resistance mechanisms differ from West Africa as the L119F-GSTe2 mutation only explains a small proportion of the genetic variance to DDT resistance.The extensive distribution of pyrethroid and DDT resistance in East African An. funestus populations represents a challenge to the control of this vector. However, the observed carbamate and organophosphate susceptibility offers alternative solutions for resistance management.",
        "L-glutamine is an efficacious glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 secretagogue in vitro. When administered with a meal, glutamine increases GLP-1 and insulin excursions and reduces postprandial glycaemia in type 2 diabetes patients. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of daily glutamine supplementation with or without the dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor sitagliptin in well-controlled type 2 diabetes patients.Type 2 diabetes patients treated with metformin (n = 13, 9 men) with baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.1±0.3% (54±4 mmol/mol) received glutamine (15 g bd)+ sitagliptin (100 mg/d) or glutamine (15 g bd) + placebo for 4 weeks in a randomized crossover study.HbA1c (P = 0.007) and fructosamine (P = 0.02) decreased modestly, without significant time-treatment interactions (both P = 0.4). Blood urea increased (P<0.001) without a significant time-treatment interaction (P = 0.8), but creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were unchanged (P≥0.5). Red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and albumin modestly decreased (P≤0.02), without significant time-treatment interactions (P≥0.4). Body weight and plasma electrolytes remained unchanged (P≥0.2).Daily oral supplementation of glutamine with or without sitagliptin for 4 weeks decreased glycaemia in well-controlled type 2 diabetes patients, but was also associated with mild plasma volume expansion.ClincalTrials.gov NCT00673894.",
        "We have previously reported high ten-week mortality from cryptococcal meningitis in Malawian adults following treatment-induction with 800 mg oral fluconazole (57% [33/58]). National guidelines in Malawi and other African countries now advocate an increased induction dose of 1200 mg. We assessed whether this has improved outcomes.This was a prospective observational study of HIV-infected adults with cryptococcal meningitis confirmed by diagnostic lumbar puncture. Treatment was with fluconazole 1200 mg/day for two weeks then 400mg/day for 8 weeks. Mortality within the first 10 weeks was the study end-point, and current results were compared with data from our prior patient cohort who started on fluconazole 800 mg/day.47 participants received fluconazole monotherapy. Despite a treatment-induction dose of 1200 mg, ten-week mortality remained 55% (26/47). This was no better than our previous study (Hazard Ratio [HR] of death on 1200 mg vs. 800 mg fluconazole: 1.29 (95% CI: 0.77-2.16, p = 0.332)). There was some evidence for improved survival in patients who had repeat lumbar punctures during early therapy to lower intracranial pressure (HR: 0.27 [95% CI: 0.07-1.03, p = 0.055]).There remains an urgent need to identify more effective, affordable and deliverable regimens for cryptococcal meningitis.",
        "Pubertal dynamics plays an important role in physical and psychological development of children and adolescents. We aim to provide reference ranges of plasma testosterone in a large longitudinal sample. Furthermore, we describe a measure of testosterone trajectories during adolescence that can be used in future investigations of development.We carried out longitudinal measurements of plasma testosterone in 2,216 samples obtained from 513 males (9 to 17 years of age) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. We used integration of a model fitted to each participant's testosterone trajectory to calculate a measure of average exposure to testosterone over adolescence. We pooled these data with corresponding values reported in the literature to provide a reference range of testosterone levels in males between the ages of 6 and 19 years.The average values of total testosterone in the ALSPAC sample range from 0.82 nmol/L (Standard Deviation [SD]: 0.09) at 9 years of age to 16.5 (SD: 2.65) nmol/L at 17 years of age; these values are congruent with other reports in the literature. The average exposure to testosterone is associated with different features of testosterone trajectories such as Peak Testosterone Change, Age at Peak Testosterone Change, and Testosterone at 17 years of age as well as the timing of the growth spurt during puberty.The average exposure to testosterone is a useful measure for future investigations using testosterone trajectories to examine pubertal dynamics.",
        "The ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) is expressed by T-cell subsets, myeloid derived suppressive cells and endothelial cells. It works in conjunction with CD39 to regulate the formation and degradation of adenosine in vivo. Adenosine has previously been shown to suppress the proliferation and cytokine secretion of T-cells and recent evidence suggests that inhibition of CD73 has the potential to enhance T-cell directed therapies. Here we utilised a CD73 knockout mouse model to assess the suppressive ability of CD73 on CD8+ T-cell classical memory and memory \"inflation\", induced by murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection and adenovirus immunisation. We show that CD73 is dispensable for normal CD8+ T-cell differentiation and function in both models. Thus CD73 as a suppressor of CD8+ T-cells is unlikely to play a deterministic role in the generation and functional characteristics of antiviral memory in these settings.",
        "Escherichia coli (ETEC) strain H10407 contains a GTPase virulence factor, LeoA, which is encoded on a pathogenicity island and has been shown to enhance toxin release, potentially through vesicle secretion. By sequence comparisons and X-ray structure determination we now identify LeoA as a bacterial dynamin-like protein (DLP). Proteins of the dynamin family remodel membranes and were once thought to be restricted to eukaryotes. In ETEC H10407 LeoA localises to the periplasm where it forms a punctate localisation pattern. Bioinformatic analyses of leoA and the two upstream genes leoB and leoC suggest that LeoA works in concert with a second dynamin-like protein, made up of LeoB and LeoC. Disruption of the leoAB genes leads to a reduction in secretion of periplasmic Tat-GFP and outer membrane OmpA. Our data suggest a role for LeoABC dynamin-like proteins in potentiating virulence through membrane vesicle associated toxin secretion.",
        "Previous reviews on risk and protective factors for violence in psychosis have produced contrasting findings. There is therefore a need to clarify the direction and strength of association of risk and protective factors for violent outcomes in individuals with psychosis.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis using 6 electronic databases (CINAHL, EBSCO, EMBASE, Global Health, PsycINFO, PUBMED) and Google Scholar. Studies were identified that reported factors associated with violence in adults diagnosed, using DSM or ICD criteria, with schizophrenia and other psychoses. We considered non-English language studies and dissertations. Risk and protective factors were meta-analysed if reported in three or more primary studies. Meta-regression examined sources of heterogeneity. A novel meta-epidemiological approach was used to group similar risk factors into one of 10 domains. Sub-group analyses were then used to investigate whether risk domains differed for studies reporting severe violence (rather than aggression or hostility) and studies based in inpatient (rather than outpatient) settings.There were 110 eligible studies reporting on 45,533 individuals, 8,439 (18.5%) of whom were violent. A total of 39,995 (87.8%) were diagnosed with schizophrenia, 209 (0.4%) were diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and 5,329 (11.8%) were diagnosed with other psychoses. Dynamic (or modifiable) risk factors included hostile behaviour, recent drug misuse, non-adherence with psychological therapies (p values<0.001), higher poor impulse control scores, recent substance misuse, recent alcohol misuse (p values<0.01), and non-adherence with medication (p value <0.05). We also examined a number of static factors, the strongest of which were criminal history factors. When restricting outcomes to severe violence, these associations did not change materially. In studies investigating inpatient violence, associations differed in strength but not direction.Certain dynamic risk factors are strongly associated with increased violence risk in individuals with psychosis and their role in risk assessment and management warrants further examination.",
        "Platelet-mediated clumping of Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes (IEs) is a frequently observed parasite adhesion phenotype. The importance of clumping in severe malaria and the molecular mechanisms behind this phenomenon are incompletely understood. Three platelet surface molecules have previously been identified as clumping receptors: CD36, globular C1q receptor (gC1qR/HABP1/p32), and P-selectin (CD62P), but the parasite ligands mediating this phenotype are unknown. The aim of this work was to develop a selection method to facilitate investigations of the molecular mechanisms of clumping in selected P. falciparum lines. Magnetic beads coated with anti-platelet antibodies were used to positively and negatively select clumping IEs from P. falciparum strains IT, HB3, 3D7 and Dd2. Clumping in all four positively selected parasite lines was abolished by antibodies to CD36, but was not affected by antibodies to gC1qR or P-selectin. Clumping positive lines showed significantly higher binding to CD36 than clumping negative lines in flow adhesion assays (strains IT, HB3 and 3D7, p<0.05 for all strains, paired t test) and static assays (strain Dd2, p<0.0001 paired t test). However, clumping negative lines IT, HB3 and 3D7 did show some binding to CD36 under flow conditions, indicating that CD36-binding is not sufficient for clumping. These data show that CD36-dependent clumping positive and negative lines can easily be selected from P. falciparum laboratory strains. CD36-binding is necessary but not sufficient for clumping, and the molecular differences between clumping positive and negative parasite lines responsible for the phenotype require further investigation.",
        "Genetic factors explain a majority of risk variance for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for late AMD implicate genes in complement, inflammatory and lipid pathways, the genetic architecture of early AMD has been relatively under studied. We conducted a GWAS meta-analysis of early AMD, including 4,089 individuals with prevalent signs of early AMD (soft drusen and/or retinal pigment epithelial changes) and 20,453 individuals without these signs. For various published late AMD risk loci, we also compared effect sizes between early and late AMD using an additional 484 individuals with prevalent late AMD. GWAS meta-analysis confirmed previously reported association of variants at the complement factor H (CFH) (peak P = 1.5×10(-31)) and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) (P = 4.3×10(-24)) loci, and suggested Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) polymorphisms (rs2075650; P = 1.1×10(-6)) associated with early AMD. Other possible loci that did not reach GWAS significance included variants in the zinc finger protein gene GLI3 (rs2049622; P = 8.9×10(-6)) and upstream of GLI2 (rs6721654; P = 6.5×10(-6)), encoding retinal Sonic hedgehog signalling regulators, and in the tyrosinase (TYR) gene (rs621313; P = 3.5×10(-6)), involved in melanin biosynthesis. For a range of published, late AMD risk loci, estimated effect sizes were significantly lower for early than late AMD. This study confirms the involvement of multiple established AMD risk variants in early AMD, but suggests weaker genetic effects on the risk of early AMD relative to late AMD. Several biological processes were suggested to be potentially specific for early AMD, including pathways regulating RPE cell melanin content and signalling pathways potentially involved in retinal regeneration, generating hypotheses for further investigation.",
        "Helminth infections may modulate immune responses to unrelated pathogens and allergens; these effects may commence prenatally. We addressed the hypothesis that anthelminthic treatment in pregnancy and early childhood would improve responses to immunisation and modulate disease incidence in early childhood with both beneficial and detrimental effects.A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Entebbe, Uganda [ISRCTN32849447]. In three independent randomisations, 2507 pregnant women were allocated to receive single-dose albendazole or placebo, and praziquantel or placebo; 2016 of their offspring were randomised to receive quarterly single-dose albendazole or placebo from age 15 months to 5 years. Primary outcomes were post-immunisation recall responses to BCG and tetanus antigens, and incidence of malaria, diarrhoea, and pneumonia; incidence of eczema was an important secondary outcome. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Of 2345 live births, 1622 (69%) children remained in follow-up at age 5 years. 68% of mothers at enrolment, and 11% of five-year-olds, had helminth infections. Maternal hookworm and Schistosoma mansoni were effectively treated by albendazole and praziquantel, respectively; and childhood hookworm and Ascaris by quarterly albendazole. Incidence rates of malaria, diarrhoea, pneumonia, and eczema were 34, 65, 10 and 5 per 100 py, respectively. Albendazole during pregnancy caused an increased rate of eczema in the children (HR 1.58 (95% CI 1.15-2.17), p = 0.005). Quarterly albendazole during childhood was associated with reduced incidence of clinical malaria (HR 0.85 (95% CI 0.73-0.98), p = 0.03). There were no consistent effects of the interventions on any other outcome.Routine use of albendazole in pregnancy may not always be beneficial, even in tropical developing countries. By contrast, regular albendazole treatment in preschool children may have an additional benefit for malaria control where helminths and malaria are co-endemic. Given the low helminth prevalence in our children, the effect of albendazole on malaria is likely to be direct.Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN32849447.",
        "Recent advances in genomics technologies have spurred unprecedented efforts in genome and exome re-sequencing aiming to unravel the genetic component of rare and complex disorders. While in rare disorders this allowed the identification of novel causal genes, the missing heritability paradox in complex diseases remains so far elusive. Despite rapid advances of next-generation sequencing, both the technology and the analysis of the data it produces are in its infancy. At present there is abundant knowledge pertaining to the role of rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in rare disorders and of common SNVs in common disorders. Although the 1,000 genome project has clearly highlighted the prevalence of rare variants and more complex variants (e.g. insertions, deletions), their role in disease is as yet far from elucidated.We set out to analyse the properties of sequence variants identified in a comprehensive collection of exome re-sequencing studies performed on samples from patients affected by a broad range of complex and rare diseases (N = 173). Given the known potential for Loss of Function (LoF) variants to be false positive, we performed an extensive validation of the common, rare and private LoF variants identified, which indicated that most of the private and rare variants identified were indeed true, while common novel variants had a significantly higher false positive rate. Our results indicated a strong enrichment of very low-frequency insertion/deletion variants, so far under-investigated, which might be difficult to capture with low coverage and imputation approaches and for which most of study designs would be under-powered. These insertions and deletions might play a significant role in disease genetics, contributing specifically to the underlining rare and private variation predicted to be discovered through next generation sequencing.",
        "Scrub typhus is an important endemic disease of the Asia-Pacific region caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. To develop an effective vaccine to prevent scrub typhus infection, a better understanding of the initial host-pathogen interaction is needed. The objective of this study was to investigate early bacterial dissemination in a CD-1 Swiss outbred mouse model after intradermal injection of O. tsutsugamushi. Three human pathogenic strains of O. tsutsugamushi (Karp, Gilliam, and Woods) were chosen to investigate the early infection characteristics associated with bacterial virulence. Tissue biopsies of the intradermal injection site and draining lymph nodes were examined using histology and immunohistochemistry to characterize bacterial dissemination, and correlated with quantitative real-time PCR for O. tsutsugamushi in blood and tissue from major organs. Soluble adhesion molecules were measured to examine cellular activation in response to infection. No eschar formation was seen at the inoculation site and no clinical disease developed within the 7 day period of observation. However, O. tsutsugamushi was localized at the injection site and in the draining lymph nodes by day 7 post inoculation. Evidence of leukocyte and endothelial activation was present by day 7 with significantly raised levels of sL-selectin, sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1. Infection with the Karp strain was associated with earlier and higher bacterial loads and more extensive dissemination in various tissues than the less pathogenic Gilliam and Woods strains. The bacterial loads of O. tsutsugamushi were highest in the lungs and spleens of mice inoculated with Karp and Gilliam, but not Woods strains. Strains of higher virulence resulted in more rapid systemic infection and dissemination in this model. The CD-1 mouse intradermal inoculation model demonstrates features relevant to early scrub typhus infection in humans, including the development of regional lymphadenopathy, leukocyte activation and distant organ dissemination after low-dose intradermal injection with O. tsutsugamushi.",
        "Transmission through breastfeeding remains important for mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) in resource-limited settings. We quantify the relationship between cell-free (RNA) and cell-associated (DNA) shedding of HIV-1 virus in breastmilk and the risk of postnatal HIV-1 transmission in the first 6 months postpartum.Thirty-six HIV-positive mothers who transmitted HIV-1 by breastfeeding were matched to 36 non-transmitting HIV-1 infected mothers in a case-control study nested in a cohort of HIV-infected women. RNA and DNA were quantified in the same breastmilk sample taken at 6 weeks and 6 months. Cox regression analysis assessed the association between cell-free and cell-associated virus levels and risk of postnatal HIV-1 transmission.There were higher median levels of cell-free than cell-associated HIV-1 virus (per ml) in breastmilk at 6 weeks and 6 months. Multivariably, adjusting for antenatal CD4 count and maternal plasma viral load, at 6 weeks, each 10-fold increase in cell-free or cell-associated levels (per ml) was significantly associated with HIV-1 transmission but stronger for cell-associated than cell-free levels [2.47 (95% CI 1.33-4.59) vs. aHR 1.52 (95% CI, 1.17-1.96), respectively]. At 6 months, cell-free and cell-associated levels (per ml) in breastmilk remained significantly associated with HIV-1 transmission but was stronger for cell-free than cell-associated levels [aHR 2.53 (95% CI 1.64-3.92) vs. 1.73 (95% CI 0.94-3.19), respectively].The findings suggest that cell-associated virus level (per ml) is more important for early postpartum HIV-1 transmission (at 6 weeks) than cell-free virus. As cell-associated virus levels have been consistently detected in breastmilk despite antiretroviral therapy, this highlights a potential challenge for resource-limited settings to achieve the UNAIDS goal for 2015 of eliminating vertical transmission. More studies would further knowledge on mechanisms of HIV-1 transmission and help develop more effective drugs during lactation.",
        "Melioidosis (Burkholderia pseudomallei infection) is a common cause of community-acquired sepsis in Northeast Thailand and northern Australia. B. pseudomallei is a soil saprophyte endemic to Southeast Asia and northern Australia. The clinical presentation of melioidosis may mimic tuberculosis (both cause chronic suppurative lesions unresponsive to conventional antibiotics and both commonly affect the lungs). The two diseases have overlapping risk profiles (e.g., diabetes, corticosteroid use), and both B. pseudomallei and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are intracellular pathogens. There are however important differences: the majority of melioidosis cases are acute, not chronic, and present with severe sepsis and a mortality rate that approaches 50% despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy. By contrast, tuberculosis is characteristically a chronic illness with mortality <2% with appropriate antimicrobial chemotherapy. We examined the gene expression profiles of total peripheral leukocytes in two cohorts of patients, one with acute melioidosis (30 patients and 30 controls) and another with tuberculosis (20 patients and 24 controls). Interferon-mediated responses dominate the host response to both infections, and both type 1 and type 2 interferon responses are important. An 86-gene signature previously thought to be specific for tuberculosis is also found in melioidosis. We conclude that the host responses to melioidosis and to tuberculosis are similar: both are dominated by interferon-signalling pathways and this similarity means gene expression signatures from whole blood do not distinguish between these two diseases.",
        "Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) catalyses the synthesis of cyclic GMP in response to nitric oxide. The enzyme is a heterodimer of homologous α and β subunits, each of which is composed of multiple domains. We present here crystal structures of a heterodimer of the catalytic domains of the α and β subunits, as well as an inactive homodimer of β subunits. This first structure of a metazoan, heteromeric cyclase provides several observations. First, the structures resemble known structures of adenylate cyclases and other guanylate cyclases in overall fold and in the arrangement of conserved active-site residues, which are contributed by both subunits at the interface. Second, the subunit interaction surface is promiscuous, allowing both homodimeric and heteromeric association; the preference of the full-length enzyme for heterodimer formation must derive from the combined contribution of other interaction interfaces. Third, the heterodimeric structure is in an inactive conformation, but can be superposed onto an active conformation of adenylate cyclase by a structural transition involving a 26° rigid-body rotation of the α subunit. In the modelled active conformation, most active site residues in the subunit interface are precisely aligned with those of adenylate cyclase. Finally, the modelled active conformation also reveals a cavity related to the active site by pseudo-symmetry. The pseudosymmetric site lacks key active site residues, but may bind allosteric regulators in a manner analogous to the binding of forskolin to adenylate cyclase. This indicates the possibility of developing a new class of small-molecule modulators of guanylate cyclase activity targeting the catalytic domain.",
        "Children in malaria endemic areas acquire immunity to severe malaria faster than to mild malaria. Only a minority of children suffers from severe malaria and it is not known what determines this. The aim of this study was to establish how P. falciparum infections during the first years of life affect the risk of severe malaria. A matched case-control study was nested within a large birth cohort set up to study the immunoepidemiology of pneumococci on the Kenyan coast. Infection patterns in three-monthly blood samples in cohort children admitted to hospital with severe malaria were compared to controls matched on age, residential location and time of sampling. P. falciparum detected at least once from birth conferred an increased risk of severe malaria and particularly if multiclonal infections, as characterized by genotyping of a polymorphic antigen gene, were ever detected. The results show for the first time that children with severe malaria have more infections early in life compared to community controls. These findings provide important insights on the immunity to severe disease, knowledge essential for the development of a vaccine against severe malaria.",
        "Previously we have shown that insertion of IS1301 in the sia/ctr intergenic region (IGR) of serogroup C Neisseria meningitidis (MenC) isolates from Spain confers increased resistance against complement-mediated killing. Here we investigate the significance of IS1301 in the same location in N. meningitidis isolates from the UK. PCR and sequencing was used to screen a collection of more than 1500 meningococcal carriage and disease isolates from the UK for the presence of IS1301 in the IGR. IS1301 was not identified in the IGR among vaccine failure strains but was frequently found in serogroup B isolates (MenB) from clonal complex 269 (cc269). Almost all IS1301 insertions in cc269 were associated with novel polymorphisms, and did not change capsule expression or resistance to human complement. After excluding sequence types (STs) distant from the central genotype within cc269, there was no significant difference for the presence of IS1301 in the IGR of carriage isolates compared to disease isolates. Isolates with insertion of IS1301 in the IGR are not responsible for MenC disease in UK vaccine failures. Novel polymorphisms associated with IS1301 in the IGR of UK MenB isolates do not lead to the resistance phenotype seen for IS1301 in the IGR of MenC isolates.",
        "HIRA (or Hir) proteins are conserved histone chaperones that function in multi-subunit complexes to mediate replication-independent nucleosome assembly. We have previously demonstrated that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe HIRA proteins, Hip1 and Slm9, form a complex with a TPR repeat protein called Hip3. Here we have identified a new subunit of this complex.To identify proteins that interact with the HIRA complex, rapid affinity purifications of Slm9 were performed. Multiple components of the chaperonin containing TCP-1 complex (CCT) and the 19S subunit of the proteasome reproducibly co-purified with Slm9, suggesting that HIRA interacts with these complexes. Slm9 was also found to interact with a previously uncharacterised protein (SPBC947.08c), that we called Hip4. Hip4 contains a HRD domain which is a characteristic of the budding yeast and human HIRA/Hir-binding proteins, Hpc2 and UBN1. Co-precipitation experiments revealed that Hip4 is stably associated with all of the other components of the HIRA complex and deletion of hip4(+) resulted in the characteristic phenotypes of cells lacking HIRA function, such as temperature sensitivity, an elongated cell morphology and hypersensitivity to the spindle poison, thiabendazole. Moreover, loss of Hip4 function alleviated the heterochromatic silencing of reporter genes located in the mating type locus and centromeres and was associated with increased levels of non-coding transcripts derived from centromeric repeat sequences. Hip4 was also found to be required for the distinct form of silencing that controls the expression of Tf2 LTR retrotransposons.Overall, these results indicate that Hip4 is an integral component of the HIRA complex that is required for transcriptional silencing at multiple loci.",
        "Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to detect copy number variants (CNVs) in mammalian genomes has led to a growing awareness of the potential importance of this category of sequence variation as a cause of phenotypic variation. Yet there are large discrepancies between studies, so that the extent of the genome affected by CNVs is unknown. We combined molecular and aCGH analyses of CNVs in inbred mouse strains to investigate this question.Using a 2.1 million probe array we identified 1,477 deletions and 499 gains in 7 inbred mouse strains. Molecular characterization indicated that approximately one third of the CNVs detected by the array were false positives and we estimate the false negative rate to be more than 50%. We show that low concordance between studies is largely due to the molecular nature of CNVs, many of which consist of a series of smaller deletions and gains interspersed by regions where the DNA copy number is normal.Our results indicate that CNVs detected by arrays may be the coincidental co-localization of smaller CNVs, whose presence is more likely to perturb an aCGH hybridization profile than the effect of an isolated, small, copy number alteration. Our findings help explain the hitherto unexplored discrepancies between array-based studies of copy number variation in the mouse genome.",
        "Early recognition and prompt and appropriate antibiotic treatment can significantly reduce mortality from serious bacterial infections (SBI). The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of five markers of infection: C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), CD163 and high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), as markers of SBI in severely ill Malawian children.Children presenting with a signs of meningitis (n = 282) or pneumonia (n = 95), were prospectively recruited. Plasma samples were taken on admission for CRP, PCT, sTREM-1 CD163 and HMGB1 and the performance characteristics of each test to diagnose SBI and to predict mortality were determined. Of 377 children, 279 (74%) had SBI and 83 (22%) died. Plasma CRP, PCT, CD163 and HMGB1 and were higher in HIV-infected children than in HIV-uninfected children (p<0.01). In HIV-infected children, CRP and PCT were higher in children with SBI compared to those with no detectable bacterial infection (p<0.0005), and PCT and CD163 were higher in non-survivors (p = 0.001, p = 0.05 respectively). In HIV-uninfected children, CRP and PCT were also higher in children with SBI compared to those with no detectable bacterial infection (p<0.0005), and CD163 was higher in non-survivors (p = 0.05). The best predictors of SBI were CRP and PCT, and areas under the curve (AUCs) were 0.81 (95% CI 0.73-0.89) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.79-0.92) respectively. The best marker for predicting death was PCT, AUC 0.61 (95% CI 0.50-0.71).Admission PCT and CRP are useful markers of invasive bacterial infection in severely ill African children. The study of these markers using rapid tests in a less selected cohort would be important in this setting.",
        "This paper questions the need for reinforcement learning or control theory when optimising behaviour. We show that it is fairly simple to teach an agent complicated and adaptive behaviours using a free-energy formulation of perception. In this formulation, agents adjust their internal states and sampling of the environment to minimize their free-energy. Such agents learn causal structure in the environment and sample it in an adaptive and self-supervised fashion. This results in behavioural policies that reproduce those optimised by reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. Critically, we do not need to invoke the notion of reward, value or utility. We illustrate these points by solving a benchmark problem in dynamic programming; namely the mountain-car problem, using active perception or inference under the free-energy principle. The ensuing proof-of-concept may be important because the free-energy formulation furnishes a unified account of both action and perception and may speak to a reappraisal of the role of dopamine in the brain.",
        "During vertebrate embryogenesis, somites are generated at regular intervals, the temporal and spatial periodicity of which is governed by a gradient of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and/or Wnt signaling activity in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) in conjunction with oscillations of gene expression of components of the Notch, Wnt and FGF signaling pathways.Here, we show that the expression of Sprouty4, which encodes an FGF inhibitor, oscillates in 2-h cycles in the mouse PSM in synchrony with other oscillating genes from the Notch signaling pathway, such as lunatic fringe. Sprouty4 does not oscillate in Hes7-null mutant mouse embryos, and Hes7 can inhibit FGF-induced transcriptional activity of the Sprouty4 promoter.Thus, periodic expression of Sprouty4 is controlled by the Notch segmentation clock and may work as a mediator that links the temporal periodicity of clock gene oscillations with the spatial periodicity of boundary formation which is regulated by the gradient of FGF/Wnt activity.",
        "The tuberculin skin test (TST) is widely used in TB clinics to aid Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) diagnosis, but the definition and the significance of a positive test in very young children is still unclear. This study compared the TST in Gambian children at 4(1/2) months of age who either received BCG vaccination at birth (Group 1) or were BCG naïve (Group 2) in order to examine the role of BCG vaccination and/or exposure to environmental mycobacteria in TST reactivity at this age. Nearly half of the BCG vaccinated children had a positive TST (>or=5 mm) whereas all the BCG naïve children were non-reactive, confirming that recent BCG vaccination affects TST reactivity. The BCG naïve children demonstrated in vitro PPD responses in peripheral blood in the absence of TST reactivity, supporting exposure to and priming by environmental mycobacterial antigens. Group 2 were then vaccinated at 4(1/2) months of age and a repeat TST was performed at 20-28 months of age. Positive reactivity (>or=5 mm) was evident in 11.1% and 12.5% infants from Group 1 and Group 2 respectively suggesting that the timing of BCG vaccination had little effect by this age. We further assessed for immune correlates in peripheral blood at 4(1/2) months of age. Mycobacterial specific IFNgamma responses were greater in TST responders than in non-responders, although the size of induration did not correlate with IFNgamma. However the IFNgamma: IL-10 ratio positively correlated with TST induration suggesting that the relationship between PPD induced IFNgamma and IL-10 in the peripheral blood may be important in controlling TST reactivity. Collectively these data provide further insights into how the TST is regulated in early life, and how a positive response might be interpreted.",
        "The Trp(620) allotype of PTPN22 confers susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and certain other classical autoimmune diseases. There has been a report of other variants within the PTPN22 locus that alter risk of RA; protective haplotype '5', haplotype group '6-10' and susceptibility haplotype '4', suggesting the possibility of other PTPN22 variants involved in the pathogenesis of RA independent of R620W (rs2476601). Our aim was to further investigate this possibility.A total of 4,460 RA cases and 4,481 controls, all European, were analysed. Single nucleotide polymorphisms rs3789607, rs12144309, rs3811021 and rs12566340 were genotyped over New Zealand (NZ) and UK samples. Publically-available Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) genotype data were used.The protective effect of haplotype 5 was confirmed (rs3789607; (OR = 0.91, P = 0.016), and a second protective effect (possibly of haplotype 6) was observed (rs12144309; OR = 0.90, P = 0.021). The previously reported susceptibility effect of haplotype 4 was not replicated; instead a protective effect was observed (rs3811021; OR = 0.85, P = 1.4×10(-5)). Haplotypes defined by rs3789607, rs12144309 and rs3811021 coalesced with the major allele of rs12566340 within the adjacent BFK (B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family kin) gene. We, therefore, tested rs12566340 for association with RA conditional on rs2476601; there was no evidence for an independent effect at rs12566340 (P = 0.76). Similarly, there was no evidence for an independent effect at rs12566340 in type 1 diabetes (P = 0.85).We have no evidence for a common variant additional to rs2476601 within the PTPN22 locus that influences the risk of RA. Arg620Trp is almost certainly the single common causal variant.",
        "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants. The rate of decay of RSV-specific maternal antibodies (RSV-matAb), the factors affecting cord blood levels, and the relationship between these levels and protection from infection are poorly defined.A birth cohort (n = 635) in rural Kenya, was studied intensively to monitor infections and describe age-related serological characteristics. RSV specific IgG antibody (Ab) in serum was measured by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in cord blood, consecutive samples taken 3 monthly, and in paired acute and convalescent samples. A linear regression model was used to calculate the rate of RSV-matAb decline. The effect of risk factors on cord blood titres was investigated.The half-life of matAb in the Kenyan cohort was calculated to be 79 days (95% confidence limits (CL): 76-81 days). Ninety seven percent of infants were born with RSV-matAb. Infants who subsequently experienced an infection in early life had significantly lower cord titres of anti-RSV Ab in comparison to infants who did not have any incident infection in the first 6 months (P = 0.011). RSV infections were shown to have no effect on the rate of decay of RSV-matAb.Maternal-specific RSV Ab decline rapidly following birth. However, we provide evidence of protection against severe disease by RSV-matAb during the first 6-7 months. This suggests that boosting maternal-specific Ab by RSV vaccination may be a useful strategy to consider.",
        "Autism, a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder manifested by deficits in social behavior and interpersonal communication, and by stereotyped, repetitive behaviors, is inexplicably biased towards males by a ratio of ∼4∶1, with no clear understanding of whether or how the sex hormones may play a role in autism susceptibility. Here, we show that male and female hormones differentially regulate the expression of a novel autism candidate gene, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-alpha (RORA) in a neuronal cell line, SH-SY5Y. In addition, we demonstrate that RORA transcriptionally regulates aromatase, an enzyme that converts testosterone to estrogen. We further show that aromatase protein is significantly reduced in the frontal cortex of autistic subjects relative to sex- and age-matched controls, and is strongly correlated with RORA protein levels in the brain. These results indicate that RORA has the potential to be under both negative and positive feedback regulation by male and female hormones, respectively, through one of its transcriptional targets, aromatase, and further suggest a mechanism for introducing sex bias in autism.",
        "Serotonin signaling influences social behavior in both human and nonhuman primates. In humans, variation upstream of the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) has recently been shown to influence both behavioral measures of social anxiety and amygdala response to social threats. Here we show that length polymorphisms in 5-HTTLPR predict social reward and punishment in rhesus macaques, a species in which 5-HTTLPR variation is analogous to that of humans.In contrast to monkeys with two copies of the long allele (L/L), monkeys with one copy of the short allele of this gene (S/L) spent less time gazing at face than non-face images, less time looking in the eye region of faces, and had larger pupil diameters when gazing at photos of a high versus low status male macaques. Moreover, in a novel primed gambling task, presentation of photos of high status male macaques promoted risk-aversion in S/L monkeys but promoted risk-seeking in L/L monkeys. Finally, as measured by a \"pay-per-view\" task, S/L monkeys required juice payment to view photos of high status males, whereas L/L monkeys sacrificed fluid to see the same photos.These data indicate that genetic variation in serotonin function contributes to social reward and punishment in rhesus macaques, and thus shapes social behavior in humans and rhesus macaques alike.",
        "In this study, we analyze the importance of O-linked oligosaccharides present in peptidorhamnomannan (PRM) from the cell wall of the fungus Scedosporium prolificans for recognition and phagocytosis of conidia by macrophages. Adding PRM led to a dose-dependent inhibition of conidia phagocytosis, whereas de-O-glycosylated PRM did not show any effect. PRM induced the release of macrophage-derived antimicrobial compounds. However, O-linked oligosaccharides do not appear to be required for such induction. The effect of PRM on conidia-induced macrophage killing was examined using latex beads coated with PRM or de-O-glycosylated PRM. A decrease in macrophage viability similar to that caused by conidia was detected. However, macrophage killing was unaffected when beads coated with de-O-glycosylated PRM were used, indicating the toxic effect of O-linked oligosaccharides on macrophages. In addition, PRM triggered TNF-α release by macrophages. Chemical removal of O-linked oligosaccharides from PRM abolished cytokine induction, suggesting that the O-linked oligosaccharidic chains are important moieties involved in inflammatory responses through the induction of TNF-α secretion. In summary, we show that O-glycosylation plays a role in the recognition and uptake of S. prolificans by macrophages, killing of macrophages and production of pro- inflammatory cytokines.",
        "Various factors that are important for proper hearing have been identified, including serum levels of zinc. Here we investigated whether epigenetic regulatory pathways, which can be modified by environmental factors, could modulate hearing. RT-PCR detected expression of genes encoding DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase (Hdac) in the postnatal as well as adult mouse auditory epithelium. DBA/2J mice, which are a model for progressive hearing loss, were injected subcutaneously with one or a combination of the following reagents: <smallcaps>L</smallcaps>-methionine as a methyl donor, valproic acid as a pan-Hdac inhibitor, and folic acid and vitamin B12 as putative factors involved in age-related hearing loss. The mice were treated from ages 4 to 12 weeks (N ≥ 5), and auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds were measured at 8, 16, and 32 kHz. Treatment of the mice with a combination of <smallcaps>L</smallcaps>-methionine and valproic acid (M+V) significantly reduced the increase in the ABR threshold at 32 kHz. Treatment with any of these reagents individually produced no such effect. Microarray analyses detected 299 gene probes that were significantly up- or down-regulated in the cochleae of mice treated with M+V compared with the control vehicle-treated mice. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed significant up-regulation of a zinc importer gene, Zip4, in the cochleae of mice treated with M+V. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated an intense Zip4 signal in cochlear tissues such as the lateral wall, organ of Corti, and spiral ganglion. Finally, mice treated with the Zip4 inducer (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate showed a significant reduction in the increase of the ABR threshold at 32 kHz and up-regulation of Zip4 expression in the cochlea. This study suggests that epigenetic regulatory pathways can modify auditory function and that zinc intake in the cochlea via Zip4 mediates maintenance of mammalian hearing.",
        "Peatlands cover more than 30% of the Finnish land area and impact N2O fluxes. Denitrifiers release N2O as an intermediate or end product. In situ N2O emissions of a near pH neutral pristine fen soil in Finnish Lapland were marginal during gas chamber measurements. However, nitrate and ammonium fertilization significantly stimulated in situ N2O emissions. Stimulation with nitrate was stronger than with ammonium. N2O was produced and subsequently consumed in gas chambers. In unsupplemented anoxic microcosms, fen soil produced N2O only when acetylene was added to block nitrous oxide reductase, suggesting complete denitrification. Nitrate and nitrite stimulated denitrification in fen soil, and maximal reaction velocities (vmax) of nitrate or nitrite dependent denitrification where 18 and 52 nmol N2O h-1 gDW-1, respectively. N2O was below 30% of total produced N gases in fen soil when concentrations of nitrate and nitrite were <500 μM. vmax for N2O consumption was up to 36 nmol N2O h-1 gDW-1. Denitrifier diversity was assessed by analyses of narG, nirK/nirS, and nosZ (encoding nitrate-, nitrite-, and nitrous oxide reductases, respectively) by barcoded amplicon pyrosequencing. Analyses of ~14,000 quality filtered sequences indicated up to 25 species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and up to 359 OTUs at 97% sequence similarity, suggesting diverse denitrifiers. Phylogenetic analyses revealed clusters distantly related to publicly available sequences, suggesting hitherto unknown denitrifiers. Representatives of species-level OTUs were affiliated with sequences of unknown soil bacteria and Actinobacterial, Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Delta-Proteobacterial sequences. Comparison of the 4 gene markers at 97% similarity indicated a higher diversity of narG than for the other gene markers based on Shannon indices and observed number of OTUs. The collective data indicate (i) a high denitrification and N2O consumption potential, and (ii) a highly diverse, nitrate limited denitrifier community associated with potential N2O fluxes in a pH-neutral fen soil.",
        "Nymphalidae is the largest family of butterflies with their phylogenetic relationships not adequately approached to date. The mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of 11 new nymphalid species were reported and a comparative mitogenomic analysis was conducted together with other 22 available nymphalid mitogenomes. A phylogenetic analysis of the 33 species from all 13 currently recognized nymphalid subfamilies was done based on the mitogenomic data set with three Lycaenidae species as the outgroups. The mitogenome comparison showed that the eleven new mitogenomes were similar with those of other butterflies in gene content and order. The reconstructed phylogenetic trees reveal that the nymphalids are made up of five major clades (the nymphaline, heliconiine, satyrine, danaine and libytheine clades), with sister relationship between subfamilies Cyrestinae and Biblidinae, and most likely between subfamilies Morphinae and Satyrinae. This whole mitogenome-based phylogeny is generally congruent with those of former studies based on nuclear-gene and mitogenomic analyses, but differs considerably from the result of morphological cladistic analysis, such as the basal position of Libytheinae in morpho-phylogeny is not confirmed in molecular studies. However, we found that the mitogenomic phylogeny established herein is compatible with selected morphological characters (including developmental and adult morpho-characters).",
        "Describing patterns of connectivity among populations of species with widespread distributions is particularly important in understanding the ecology and evolution of marine species. In this study, we examined patterns of population differentiation, migration, and historical population dynamics using microsatellite and mitochondrial loci to test whether populations of the epinephelid fish, Gag, Mycteroperca microlepis, an important fishery species, are genetically connected across the Gulf of Mexico and if so, whether that connectivity is attributable to either contemporary or historical processes. Populations of Gag on the Campeche Bank and the West Florida Shelf show significant, but low magnitude, differentiation. Time since divergence/expansion estimates associated with historical population dynamics indicate that any population or spatial expansions indicated by population genetics would have likely occurred in the late Pleistocene. Using coalescent-based approaches, we find that the best model for explaining observed spatial patterns of contemporary genetic variation is one of asymmetric gene flow, with movement from Campeche Bank to the West Florida Shelf. Both estimated migration rates and ecological data support the hypothesis that Gag populations throughout the Gulf of Mexico are connected via present day larval dispersal. Demonstrating this greatly expanded scale of connectivity for Gag highlights the influence of \"ghost\" populations (sensu Beerli) on genetic patterns and presents a critical consideration for both fisheries management and conservation of this and other species with similar genetic patterns.",
        "We present a general approach in 1H-detected 13C solid-state NMR (SSNMR) for side-chain signal assignments of 10-50 nmol quantities of proteins using a combination of a high magnetic field, ultra-fast magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ~80 kHz, and stereo-array-isotope-labeled (SAIL) proteins [Kainosho M. et al., Nature 440, 52-57, 2006]. First, we demonstrate that 1H indirect detection improves the sensitivity and resolution of 13C SSNMR of SAIL proteins for side-chain assignments in the ultra-fast MAS condition. 1H-detected SSNMR was performed for micro-crystalline ubiquitin (~55 nmol or ~0.5mg) that was SAIL-labeled at seven isoleucine (Ile) residues. Sensitivity was dramatically improved by 1H-detected 2D 1H/13C SSNMR by factors of 5.4-9.7 and 2.1-5.0, respectively, over 13C-detected 2D 1H/13C SSNMR and 1D 13C CPMAS, demonstrating that 2D 1H-detected SSNMR offers not only additional resolution but also sensitivity advantage over 1D 13C detection for the first time. High 1H resolution for the SAIL-labeled side-chain residues offered reasonable resolution even in the 2D data. A 1H-detected 3D 13C/13C/1H experiment on SAIL-ubiquitin provided nearly complete 1H and 13C assignments for seven Ile residues only within ~2.5 h. The results demonstrate the feasibility of side-chain signal assignment in this approach for as little as 10 nmol of a protein sample within ~3 days. The approach is likely applicable to a variety of proteins of biological interest without any requirements of highly efficient protein expression systems.",
        "Clinical studies have shown that Medically Unexplained Symptoms (MUS) are related to common mental disorders. It is unknown how often common mental disorders occur in subjects who have explained physical symptoms (PHY), MUS or both, in the general population, what the incidence rates are, and whether there is a difference between PHY and MUS in this respect.To study the prevalence and incidence rates of mood, anxiety and substance use disorders in groups with PHY, MUS and combined MUS and PHY compared to a no-symptoms reference group in the general population.Data were derived from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 (NEMESIS-2), a nationally representative face-to-face survey of the general population aged 18-64 years. We selected subjects with explained physical symptoms only (n=1952), with MUS only (n=177), with both MUS and PHY (n=209), and a reference group with no physical symptoms (n=4168). The assessment of common mental disorders was through the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between group membership and the prevalence and first-incidence rates of comorbid mental disorders, adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics.MUS were associated with the highest prevalence rates of mood and anxiety disorders, and combined MUS and PHY with the highest prevalence rates of substance disorder. Combined MUS and PHY were associated with a higher incidence rate of mood disorder only (OR 2.9 (95%CI:1.27,6.74)).In the general population, PHY, MUS and the combination of both are related to mood and anxiety disorder, but odds are highest for combined MUS and PHY in relation to substance use disorder. Combined MUS and PHY are related to a greater incidence of mood disorder. These findings warrant further research into possibilities to improve recognition and early intervention in subjects with combined MUS and PHY.",
        "Macaranga myrmecophytes (ant-plants) are generally well protected from herbivore attacks by their symbiotic ants (plant-ants). However, larvae of Arhopala (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) species survive and develop on specific Macaranga ant-plant species without being attacked by the plant-ants of their host species. We hypothesized that Arhopala larvae chemically mimic or camouflage themselves with the ants on their host plant so that the larvae are accepted by the plant-ant species of their host. Chemical analyses of cuticular hydrocarbons showed that chemical congruency varied among Arhopala species; A. dajagaka matched well the host plant-ants, A. amphimuta did not match, and unexpectedly, A. zylda lacked hydrocarbons. Behaviorally, the larvae and dummies coated with cuticular chemicals of A. dajagaka were well attended by the plant-ants, especially by those of the host. A. amphimuta was often attacked by all plant-ants except for the host plant-ants toward the larvae, and those of A. zylda were ignored by all plant-ants. Our results suggested that conspicuous variations exist in the chemical strategies used by the myrmecophilous butterflies that allow them to avoid ant attack and be accepted by the plant-ant colonies.",
        "Airway microbiota composition has been clearly correlated with many pulmonary diseases, and notably with cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal genetic disorder caused by mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Recently, a new molecule, ivacaftor, has been shown to re-establish the functionality of the G551D-mutated CFTR, allowing significant improvement in lung function.The purpose of this study was to follow the evolution of the airway microbiota in CF patients treated with ivacaftor, using quantitative PCR and pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons, in order to identify quantitative and qualitative changes in bacterial communities. Three G551D children were followed up longitudinally over a mean period of more than one year covering several months before and after initiation of ivacaftor treatment.129 operational taxonomy units (OTUs), representing 64 genera, were identified. There was no significant difference in total bacterial load before and after treatment. Comparison of global community composition found no significant changes in microbiota. Two OTUs, however, showed contrasting dynamics: after initiation of ivacaftor, the relative abundance of the anaerobe Porphyromonas 1 increased (p<0.01) and that of Streptococcus 1 (S. mitis group) decreased (p<0.05), possibly in relation to the anti-Gram-positive properties of ivacaftor. The anaerobe Prevotella 2 correlated positively with the pulmonary function test FEV-1 (r=0.73, p<0.05). The study confirmed the presumed positive role of anaerobes in lung function.Several airway microbiota components, notably anaerobes (obligate or facultative anaerobes), could be valuable biomarkers of lung function improvement under ivacaftor, and could shed light on the pathophysiology of lung disease in CF patients.",
        "Predation and hunter harvest constitute the main mortality factors affecting the size and dynamics of many exploited populations. The re-colonization by wolves (Canis lupus) of the Scandinavian Peninsula may therefore substantially reduce hunter harvest of moose (Alces alces), the main prey of wolves.We examined possible effects of wolf presence on hunter harvest in areas where we had data before and after wolf establishment (n = 25), and in additional areas that had been continuously exposed to wolf predation during at least ten years (n = 43). There was a general reduction in the total number of moose harvested (n = 31,827) during the ten year study period in all areas irrespective of presence of wolves or not. However, the reduction in hunter harvest was stronger within wolf territories compared to control areas without wolves. The reduction in harvest was larger in small (500-800 km2) compared to large (1,200-1,800 km2) wolf territories. In areas with newly established wolf territories moose management appeared to be adaptive with regard to both managers (hunting quotas) and to hunters (actual harvest). In these areas an instant reduction in moose harvest over-compensated the estimated number of moose killed annually by wolves and the composition of the hunted animals changed towards a lower proportion of adult females.We show that the re-colonization of wolves may result in an almost instant functional response by another large predator-humans-that reduced the potential for a direct numerical effect on the density of wolves' main prey, the moose. Because most of the worlds' habitat that will be available for future colonization by large predators are likely to be strongly influenced by humans, human behavioural responses may constitute a key trait that govern the impact of large predators on their prey.",
        "As a fundamental characteristic of soil physical properties, the soil Particle Size Distribution (PSD) is important in the research on soil moisture migration, solution transformation, and soil erosion. In this research, the PSD characteristics with distinct methods in different land uses are analyzed. The results show that the upper bound of the volume domain of the clay domain ranges from 5.743 μm to 5.749 μm for all land-use types. For the silt domain of purple soil, the value ranges among 286.852~286.966 μm. For all purple soil land-use types, the order of the volume domain fractal dimensions is D clay<D silt<D sand. However, the values of D silt and D sand in the Pinus massoniana Lamb, Robinia pseudoacacia L and Ipomoea batatas are all higher than the corresponding values in the Citrus reticulate Blanco and Setaria viridis. Moreover, in all the land-use types, all of the parameters in volume domain fractal dimension (Dvi) are higher than the corresponding parameter values from the United States Department of Agriculture (Dvi(U)). The correlation study between the volume domain fractal dimension and the soil properties shows that the intensity of correlation to the soil texture and soil organic matter has the order as: D silt>D silt(U)>D sand (U)>D sand and D silt>D silt(U)>D sand>D sand(U), respectively. As it is compared with all Dvi, the D silt has the most significant correlativity to the soil texture and organic matter in different land uses of the typical purple soil watersheds. Therefore, Dsilt will be a potential indictor for evaluating the proportion of fine particles in the PSD, as well as a key measurement in soil quality and productivity studies.",
        "To evaluate the clinical treatment effects of orthokeratology to slow the progression of myopia.Several well-designed controlled studies have investigated the effects of orthokeratology in school-aged children. We conducted this meta-analysis to better evaluate the existing evidence. Relevant studies were identified in the Medline and Embase database without language limitations. The main outcomes included axial length and vitreous chamber depth reported as the mean ± standard deviation. The results were pooled and assessed with a fixed-effects model analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed according to geographical location and study design.Of the seven eligible studies, all reported axial length changes after 2 years, while two studies reported vitreous chamber depth changes. The pooled estimates indicated that change in axial length in the ortho-k group was 0.27 mm (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.22, 0.32) less than the control group. Myopic progression was reduced by approximately 45%. The combined results revealed that the difference in vitreous chamber depth between the two groups was 0.22 mm (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.14, 0.31). None of the studies reported severe adverse events.The overall findings suggest that ortho-k can slow myopia progression in school-aged children.",
        "Inter-personal synchronization is important for performing many cooperative tasks. Notably, synchrony has also been shown to have considerable positive social influences, possibly mediated by synchrony-induced changes in social attitude such as an increased sense of similarity and affiliation between interacting individuals. This effect has been demonstrated in adults, but it is unknown whether synchrony might have a similar impact on the social attitudes of children. We thus set to directly examine the influence of synchronous rhythmic interaction on perceived similarity and closeness in pairs of 8-9 year old children. We found that children who had participated in a synchronous interaction regarded their interacting partner as more similar and closer to themselves than children who had not interacted at all or who had taken part in an asynchronous interaction. These findings reveal that synchronous interaction can positively alter social attitudes between interacting children, suggesting a potential mechanism by which synchrony may enhance positive social interaction through attitudinal shift.",
        "A possible mechanistic pathway related to an enzyme-catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition reaction was studied by theoretical calculations at density functional (B3LYP, O3LYP, M062X) and semiempirical levels (PM6-DH2, PM6) performed on a model system. The calculations were carried out for the key [4+2] cycloaddition step considering enzyme-catalyzed biosynthesis of Spinosyn A in a model reaction, where a reliable example of a biological Diels-Alder reaction was reported experimentally. In the present study it was demonstrated that the [4+2] cycloaddition reaction may benefit from moving along the energetically balanced reaction coordinate, which enabled the catalytic rate enhancement of the [4+2] cycloaddition pathway involving a single transition state. Modeling of such a system with coordination of three amino acids indicated a reliable decrease of activation energy by ~18.0 kcal/mol as compared to a non-catalytic transformation.",
        "The prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) is higher in those with low levels of educational attainment, the unemployed and those with low social status. However the extent to which these factors cause MDD is unclear. Most of the available data comes from studies in developed countries, and these findings may not extrapolate to developing countries. Examining the relationship between MDD and socio economic status in China is likely to add to the debate because of the radical economic and social changes occurring in China over the last 30 years.We report results from 3,639 Chinese women with recurrent MDD and 3,800 controls. Highly significant odds ratios (ORs) were observed between MDD and full time employment (OR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.25-0.46, logP = 78), social status (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.77-0.87, logP = 13.3) and education attainment (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.86-0.90, logP = 6.8). We found a monotonic relationship between increasing age and increasing levels of educational attainment. Those with only primary school education have significantly more episodes of MDD (mean 6.5, P-value = 0.009) and have a clinically more severe disorder, while those with higher educational attainment are likely to manifest more comorbid anxiety disorders.In China lower socioeconomic position is associated with increased rates of MDD, as it is elsewhere in the world. Significantly more episodes of MDD occur among those with lower educational attainment (rather than longer episodes of disease), consistent with the hypothesis that the lower socioeconomic position increases the likelihood of developing MDD. The phenomenology of MDD varies according to the degree of educational attainment: higher educational attainment not only appears to protect against MDD but alters its presentation, to a more anxious phenotype.",
        "The relationship between loss-to-follow-up (LTFU) in HIV treatment and care programmes and psychosocial factors, including self-reported stigma, is important to understand. This prospective cohort study explored stigma and LTFU in treatment eligible adults who had yet not started antiretroviral therapy (ART).Psychosocial, clinical and demographic data were collected at a baseline interview. Self-reported stigma was measured with a multi-item scale. LTFU was defined as not attending clinic in the 90 days since last appointment or before death. Data was collected between January 2009 and January 2013 and analysed using Cox Regression.380 individuals were recruited (median time in study 3.35 years, total time at risk 1065.81 person-years). 203 were retained (53.4%), 109 were LTFU (28.7%), 48 had died and were not LTFU at death (12.6%) and 20 had transferred out (5.3%). The LTFU rate was 10.65 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 8.48-12.34). 362 individuals (95.3%) started ART. Stigma total score (categorised in quartiles) was not significantly associated with LTFU in either univariable or multivariable analysis (adjusting for other variables in the final model): second quartile aHR 0.77 (95%CI: 0.41-1.46), third quartile aHR 1.20(95%CI: 0.721-2.04), fourth quartile aHR 0.62 (95%CI: 0.35-1.11). In the final multivariable model, higher LTFU rates were associated with male gender, increased openness with friends/family and believing that community problems would be solved at higher levels. Lower LTFU rates were independently associated with increased year of age, greater reliance on family/friends, and having children.Demographic and other psychosocial factors were more closely related to LTFU than self-reported stigma. This may be consistent with high levels of social exposure to HIV and ART and with stigma affecting LTFU less than other stages of care. Research and clinical implications are discussed.",
        "Reliable and valid biomarkers of ageing (BoA) are needed to understand mechanisms, test interventions and predict the timing of adverse health events associated with ageing. Since increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial dysfunction are consequences of cellular senescence and may contribute causally to the ageing of organisms, we focused on these parameters as candidate BoA. Superoxide levels, mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and subpopulations (lymphocytes and monocytes) were measured in participants from the Newcastle 85+ study, a population-based study of the very old (aged 85 years and older). The intra- and inter-assay precision expressed as coefficient of variation (CV) for all parameters was acceptable (3% to 12% and 5 to 22% respectively). All parameters were stable in the short-term (1 week interval) in a sample of control individuals in the PBMCs and lymphocyte subpopulation, however they were unstable in the monocyte subpopulation; this rendered monocytes unreliable for further analysis. There was a significant association between superoxide levels and mitochondrial mass (positive in lymphocytes, p = 0.01) and between superoxide levels and mitochondrial membrane potential (negative in PBMCs, p = 0.01; positive in lymphocytes, p = 0.05). There were also significant associations between superoxide levels and mitochondrial parameters with other markers of oxidative stress-induced cellular senescence (p≤0.04), however some were in the opposite direction to expected. No associations were found between the measured parameters and age-related outcomes, including cognitive impairment, disability, co-morbidity and survival - questioning the validity of these parameters as candidate BoA in the very old.",
        "TDP-43 is found in cytoplasmic inclusions in 95% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 60% of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Approximately 4% of familial ALS is caused by mutations in TDP-43. The majority of these mutations are found in the glycine-rich domain, including the variant M337V, which is one of the most common mutations in TDP-43. In order to investigate the use of allele-specific RNA interference (RNAi) as a potential therapeutic tool, we designed and screened a set of siRNAs that specifically target TDP-43(M337V) mutation. Two siRNA specifically silenced the M337V mutation in HEK293T cells transfected with GFP-TDP-43(wt) or GFP-TDP-43(M337V) or TDP-43 C-terminal fragments counterparts. C-terminal TDP-43 transfected cells show an increase of cytosolic inclusions, which are decreased after allele-specific siRNA in M337V cells. We then investigated the effects of one of these allele-specific siRNAs in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from an ALS patient carrying the M337V mutation. These lines showed a two-fold increase in cytosolic TDP-43 compared to the control. Following transfection with the allele-specific siRNA, cytosolic TDP-43 was reduced by 30% compared to cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA. We conclude that RNA interference can be used to selectively target the TDP-43(M337V) allele in mammalian and patient cells, thus demonstrating the potential for using RNA interference as a therapeutic tool for ALS.",
        "BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor that is over-expressed due to chromosomal translocations, or other abnormalities, in ∼40% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. BCL6 interacts with co-repressor, SMRT, and this is essential for its role in lymphomas. Peptide or small molecule inhibitors, which prevent the association of SMRT with BCL6, inhibit transcriptional repression and cause apoptosis of lymphoma cells in vitro and in vivo. In order to discover compounds, which have the potential to be developed into BCL6 inhibitors, we screened a natural product library. The ansamycin antibiotic, rifamycin SV, inhibited BCL6 transcriptional repression and NMR spectroscopy confirmed a direct interaction between rifamycin SV and BCL6. To further determine the characteristics of compounds binding to BCL6-POZ we analyzed four other members of this family and showed that rifabutin, bound most strongly. An X-ray crystal structure of the rifabutin-BCL6 complex revealed that rifabutin occupies a partly non-polar pocket making interactions with tyrosine58, asparagine21 and arginine24 of the BCL6-POZ domain. Importantly these residues are also important for the interaction of BLC6 with SMRT. This work demonstrates a unique approach to developing a structure activity relationship for a compound that will form the basis of a therapeutically useful BCL6 inhibitor.",
        "SDF-1/CXCR4 signalling plays an important role in neuronal cell migration and brain development. However, the impact of CXCR4 deficiency in the postnatal mouse brain is still poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate the importance of CXCR4 on cerebellar development and motor behaviour by conditional inactivation of Cxcr4 in the central nervous system. We found CXCR4 plays a key role in cerebellar development. Its loss leads to defects in Purkinje cell dentritogenesis and axonal projection in vivo but not in cell culture. Transcriptome analysis revealed the most significantly affected pathways in the Cxcr4 deficient developing cerebellum are involved in extra cellular matrix receptor interactions and focal adhesion. Consistent with functional impairment of the cerebellum, Cxcr4 knockout mice have poor coordination and balance performance in skilled motor tests. Together, these results suggest ectopic the migration of granule cells impairs development of Purkinje cells, causes gross cerebellar anatomical disruption and leads to behavioural motor defects in Cxcr4 null mice.",
        "Neurofeedback based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a new approach that allows training of voluntary control over regionally specific brain activity. However, the neural basis of successful neurofeedback learning remains poorly understood. Here, we assessed changes in effective brain connectivity associated with neurofeedback training of visual cortex activity. Using dynamic causal modeling (DCM), we found that training participants to increase visual cortex activity was associated with increased effective connectivity between the visual cortex and the superior parietal lobe. Specifically, participants who learned to control activity in their visual cortex showed increased top-down control of the superior parietal lobe over the visual cortex, and at the same time reduced bottom-up processing. These results are consistent with efficient employment of top-down visual attention and imagery, which were the cognitive strategies used by participants to increase their visual cortex activity.",
        "Wolbachia bacteria are common endosymbionts of insects, and some strains are known to protect their hosts against RNA viruses and other parasites. This has led to the suggestion that releasing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes could prevent the transmission of arboviruses and other human parasites. We have identified Wolbachia in Kenyan populations of the yellow fever vector Aedes bromeliae and its relative Aedes metallicus, and in Mansonia uniformis and Mansonia africana, which are vectors of lymphatic filariasis. These Wolbachia strains cluster together on the bacterial phylogeny, and belong to bacterial clades that have recombined with other unrelated strains. These new Wolbachia strains may be affecting disease transmission rates of infected mosquito species, and could be transferred into other mosquito vectors as part of control programs.",
        "In sub-Saharan Africa, early mortality is high following initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We investigated 6-month outcomes and factors associated with mortality in HIV-infected adults being assessed for ART initiation and presenting with weight loss, chronic fever or diarrhea, and with negative TB sputum microscopy.A prospective cohort study was conducted in Malawi, investigating mortality in relation to ART uptake, microbiological findings and treatment of opportunistic infection (OIs), 6 months after meeting ART eligibility criteria.Of 469 consecutive adults eligible for ART, 74(16%) died within 6 months of enrolment, at a median of 41 days (IQR 20-81). 370(79%) started ART at a median time of 18 days (IQR 7-40) after enrolment. Six-month case-fatality rates were higher in patients with OIs; 25/121(21%) in confirmed/clinical TB and 10/50(20%) with blood stream infection (BSI) compared to 41/308(13%) in patients with no infection identified. Median TB treatment start was 27 days (IQR 17-65) after enrolment and mortality [8 deaths (44%)] was significantly higher among 18 culture-positive patients with delayed TB diagnosis compared to patients diagnosed clinically and treated promptly with subsequent culture confirmation [6/34 (18%);p = 0.04]. Adjusted multivariable analysis, excluding deaths in the first 21 days, showed weight loss >10%, low CD4 count, severe anemia, laboratory-only TB diagnosis, and not initiating ART to be independently associated with increased risk of death.Mortality remains high among chronically ill patients eligible for ART. Prompt initiation of ART is vital: more than half of deaths were among patients who never started ART. Diagnostic and treatment delay for TB was strongly associated with risk of death. More than half of deaths occurred without identification of a specific infection. ART programmes need access to rapid point-of-care-diagnostic tools for OIs. The role of early empiric OI treatment in this population requires further evaluation in clinical trials.",
        "Originally the novel protein Blom7α was identified as novel pre-mRNA splicing factor that interacts with SNEV(Prp19/Pso4), an essential protein involved in extension of human endothelial cell life span, DNA damage repair, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and pre-mRNA splicing. Blom7α belongs to the heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein K homology (KH) protein family, displaying 2 KH domains, a well conserved and widespread RNA-binding motif. In order to identify specific sequence binding motifs, we here used Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) with a synthetic RNA library. Besides sequence motifs like (U/A)(1-4) C(2-6) (U/A)(1-5), we identified an AC-rich RNA-aptamer that we termed AK48 (Aptamer KH-binding 48), binding to Blom7α with high affinity. Addition of AK48 to pre-mRNA splicing reactions in vitro inhibited the formation of mature spliced mRNA and led to a slight accumulation of the H complex of the spliceosome. These results suggest that the RNA binding activity of Blom7α might be required for pre-mRNA splicing catalysis. The inhibition of in-vitro splicing by the small RNA AK48 indicates the potential use of small RNA molecules in targeting the spliceosome complex as a novel target for drug development.",
        "This paper introduces a model of oculomotor control during the smooth pursuit of occluded visual targets. This model is based upon active inference, in which subjects try to minimise their (proprioceptive) prediction error based upon posterior beliefs about the hidden causes of their (exteroceptive) sensory input. Our model appeals to a single principle--the minimisation of variational free energy--to provide Bayes optimal solutions to the smooth pursuit problem. However, it tries to accommodate the cardinal features of smooth pursuit of partially occluded targets that have been observed empirically in normal subjects and schizophrenia. Specifically, we account for the ability of normal subjects to anticipate periodic target trajectories and emit pre-emptive smooth pursuit eye movements--prior to the emergence of a target from behind an occluder. Furthermore, we show that a single deficit in the postsynaptic gain of prediction error units (encoding the precision of posterior beliefs) can account for several features of smooth pursuit in schizophrenia: namely, a reduction in motor gain and anticipatory eye movements during visual occlusion, a paradoxical improvement in tracking unpredicted deviations from target trajectories and a failure to recognise and exploit regularities in the periodic motion of visual targets. This model will form the basis of subsequent (dynamic causal) models of empirical eye tracking measurements, which we hope to validate, using psychopharmacology and studies of schizophrenia.",
        "Children with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) represent a huge reservoir for future disease. We wished to determine Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection prevalence among BCG-immunised five-year-old children in Entebbe, Uganda, but there are limited data on the performance of immunoassays for diagnosis of tuberculosis infection in children in endemic settings. We therefore evaluated agreement between a commercial interferon gamma release assay (T-SPOT.TB) and the tuberculin skin test (TST; 2 units RT-23 tuberculin; positive defined as diameter ≥10 mm), along with the reproducibility of T-SPOT.TB on short-term follow-up, in this population.We recruited 907 children of which 56 were household contacts of TB patients. They were tested with T-SPOT.TB at age five years and then re-examined with T-SPOT.TB (n = 405) and TST (n = 319) approximately three weeks later. The principal outcome measures were T-SPOT.TB and TST positivity. At five years, 88 (9.7%) children tested positive by T-SPOT.TB. More than half of those that were T-SPOT.TB positive at five years were negative at follow-up, whereas 96% of baseline negatives were consistently negative. We observed somewhat better agreement between initial and follow-up T-SPOT.TB results among household TB contacts (κ = 0.77) than among non-contacts (κ = 0.39). Agreement between T-SPOT.TB and TST was weak (κ = 0.28 and κ = 0.40 for T-SPOT.TB at 5 years and follow-up, respectively). Of 28 children who were positive on both T-SPOT.TB tests, 14 (50%) had a negative TST. Analysis of spot counts showed high levels of instability in responses between baseline and follow-up, indicating variability in circulating numbers of T cells specific for certain M.tb antigens.We found that T-SPOT.TB positives are unstable over a three-week follow-up interval, and that TST compares poorly with T-SPOT.TB, making the categorisation of children as TB-infected or TB-uninfected difficult. Existing tools for the diagnosis of TB infection are unsatisfactory in determining infection among children in this setting.",
        "Severe malaria (SM) is a major cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa. Identification of both specific and sensitive clinical features to predict death is needed to improve clinical management.A 13-year observational study was conducted from 1997 through 2009 of 2,901 children with SM enrolled at the Royal Victoria Teaching Hospital in The Gambia to identify sensitive and specific predictors of poor outcome in Gambian children with severe malaria between the ages 4 months to 14 years. We have measured the sensitivity and specificity of clinical features that predict death or development of neurological sequelae.Impaired consciousness (odds ratio {OR} 4.4 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.7-7.3]), respiratory distress (OR 2.4 [95%CI, 1.7-3.2]), hypoglycemia (OR 1.7 [95%CI, 1.2-2.3]), jaundice (OR 1.9 [95%CI, 1.2-2.9]) and renal failure (OR 11.1 [95%CI, 3.3-36.5]) were independently associated with death in children with SM. The clinical features that showed the highest sensitivity and specificity to predict death were respiratory distress (area under the curve 0.63 [95%CI, 0.60-0.65]) and impaired consciousness (AUC 0.61[95%CI, 0.59-0.63]), which were comparable to the ability of hyperlactatemia (blood lactate>5 mM) to predict death (AUC 0.64 [95%CI, 0.55-0.72]). A Blantyre coma score (BCS) of 2 or less had a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 67% to predict death (AUC 0.70 [95% C.I. 0.68-0.72]), and sensitivity and specificity of 74% and 69%, respectively to predict development of neurological sequelae (AUC 0.72 [95% CI, 0.67-0.76]).The specificity of this BCS threshold to identify children at risk of dying improved in children less than 3 years of age (AUC 0.74, [95% C.I 0.71-0.76]).The BCS is a quantitative predictor of death. A BCS of 2 or less is the most sensitive and specific clinical feature to predict death or development of neurological sequelae in children with SM.",
        "Previous research suggested that structural and functional abnormalities within the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex contribute to the pathophysiology of Conduct Disorder (CD). Here, we investigated whether the integrity of the white-matter pathways connecting these regions is abnormal and thus may represent a putative neurobiological marker for CD.Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) was used to investigate white-matter microstructural integrity in male adolescents with childhood-onset CD, compared with healthy controls matched in age, sex, intelligence, and socioeconomic status. Two approaches were employed to analyze DTI data: voxel-based morphometry of fractional anisotropy (FA), an index of white-matter integrity, and virtual dissection of white-matter pathways using tractography.Adolescents with CD displayed higher FA within the right external capsule relative to controls (T = 6.08, P<0.05, Family-Wise Error, whole-brain correction). Tractography analyses showed that FA values within the uncinate fascicle (connecting the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex) were abnormally increased in individuals with CD relative to controls. This was in contrast with the inferior frontal-occipital fascicle, which showed no significant group differences in FA. The finding of increased FA in the uncinate fascicle remained significant when factoring out the contribution of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms. There were no group differences in the number of streamlines in either of these anatomical tracts.These results provide evidence that CD is associated with white-matter microstructural abnormalities in the anatomical tract that connects the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, the uncinate fascicle. These results implicate abnormal maturation of white-matter pathways which are fundamental in the regulation of emotional behavior in CD.",
        "Current influenza vaccines have reduced immunogenicity and are of uncertain efficacy in older adults. We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of MVA-NP+M1, a viral-vectored influenza vaccine designed to boost memory T cell responses, in a group of older adults.Thirty volunteers (aged 50-85) received a single intramuscular injection of MVA-NP+M1 at a dose of 1·5×10(8) plaque forming units (pfu). Safety and immunogenicity were assessed over a period of one year. The frequency of T cells specific for nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein 1 (M1) was determined by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) ELISpot, and their phenotypic and functional properties were characterized by polychromatic flow cytometry. In a subset of M1-specific CD8(+) T cells, T cell receptor (TCR) gene expression was evaluated using an unbiased molecular approach.Vaccination with MVA-NP+M1 was well tolerated. ELISpot responses were boosted significantly above baseline following vaccination. Increases were detected in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell subsets. Clonality studies indicated that MVA-NP+M1 expanded pre-existing memory CD8(+) T cells, which displayed a predominant CD27(+)CD45RO(+)CD57(-)CCR7(-) phenotype both before and after vaccination.MVA-NP+M1 is safe and immunogenic in older adults. Unlike seasonal influenza vaccination, the immune responses generated by MVA-NP+M1 are similar between younger and older individuals. A T cell-inducing vaccine such as MVA-NP+M1 may therefore provide a way to circumvent the immunosenescence that impairs routine influenza vaccination.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00942071.",
        "Vitamin B-12 is essential for the development and maintenance of a healthy nervous system. Brain development occurs primarily in utero and early infancy, but the role of maternal vitamin B-12 status during pregnancy on offspring cognitive function is unclear. In this study we assessed the effect of vitamin B-12 status in well-nourished pregnant women on the cognitive ability of their offspring in a UK birth cohort (ALSPAC). We then examined the association of SNPs in maternal genes FUT2 (rs492602) and TCN2 (rs1801198, rs9606756) that are related to plasma vitamin B-12, with offspring IQ. Observationally, there was a positive association between maternal vitamin B-12 intake and child's IQ that was markedly attenuated after adjustment for potential confounders (mean difference in offspring IQ score per doubling of maternal B-12 intake, before adjustment: 2.0 (95% CI 1.3, 2.8); after adjustment: 0.7 (95% CI -0.04, 1.4)). Maternal FUT2 was weakly associated with offspring IQ: mean difference in IQ per allele was 0.9 (95% CI 0.1, 1.6). The expected effect of maternal vitamin B-12 on offspring IQ, given the relationships between SNPs and vitamin B-12, and SNPs and IQ was consistent with the observational result. Our findings suggest that maternal vitamin B-12 may not have an important effect on offspring cognitive ability. However, further examination of this issue is warranted.",
        "Bradykinesia is a cardinal feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite its disabling impact, the precise cause of this symptom remains elusive. Recent thinking suggests that bradykinesia may be more than simply a manifestation of motor slowness, and may in part reflect a specific deficit in the operation of motivational vigour in the striatum. In this paper we test the hypothesis that movement time in PD can be modulated by the specific nature of the motivational salience of possible action-outcomes.We developed a novel movement time paradigm involving winnable rewards and avoidable painful electrical stimuli. The faster the subjects performed an action the more likely they were to win money (in appetitive blocks) or to avoid a painful shock (in aversive blocks). We compared PD patients when OFF dopaminergic medication with controls. Our key finding is that PD patients OFF dopaminergic medication move faster to avoid aversive outcomes (painful electric shocks) than to reap rewarding outcomes (winning money) and, unlike controls, do not speed up in the current trial having failed to win money in the previous one. We also demonstrate that sensitivity to distracting stimuli is valence specific.We suggest this pattern of results can be explained in terms of low dopamine levels in the Parkinsonian state leading to an insensitivity to appetitive outcomes, and thus an inability to modulate movement speed in the face of rewards. By comparison, sensitivity to aversive stimuli is relatively spared. Our findings point to a rarely described property of bradykinesia in PD, namely its selective regulation by everyday outcomes.",
        "Control and elimination of malaria still represents a major public health challenge. Emerging parasite resistance to current therapies urges development of antimalarials with novel mechanism of action. Phospholipid biosynthesis of the Plasmodium parasite has been validated as promising candidate antimalarial target. The most prevalent de novo pathway for synthesis of phosphatidylcholine is the Kennedy pathway. Its regulatory and often also rate limiting step is catalyzed by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT). The CHO-MT58 cell line expresses a mutant variant of CCT, and displays a thermo-sensitive phenotype. At non-permissive temperature (40°C), the endogenous CCT activity decreases dramatically, blocking membrane synthesis and ultimately leading to apoptosis. In the present study we investigated the impact of the analogous mutation in a catalytic domain construct of Plasmodium falciparum CCT in order to explore the underlying molecular mechanism that explains this phenotype. We used temperature dependent enzyme activity measurements and modeling to investigate the functionality of the mutant enzyme. Furthermore, MS measurements were performed to determine the oligomerization state of the protein, and MD simulations to assess the inter-subunit interactions in the dimer. Our results demonstrate that the R681H mutation does not directly influence enzyme catalytic activity. Instead, it provokes increased heat-sensitivity by destabilizing the CCT dimer. This can possibly explain the significance of the PfCCT pseudoheterodimer organization in ensuring proper enzymatic function. This also provide an explanation for the observed thermo-sensitive phenotype of CHO-MT58 cell line.",
        "We developed an immunochromatography-based assay for detecting antibodies against recombinant α-galactosidase A proteins in serum. The evaluation of 29 serum samples from Fabry patients, who had received enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase alpha and/or agalsidase beta, was performed by means of this assay method, and the results clearly revealed that the patients exhibited the same level of antibodies against both agalsidase alpha and agalsidase beta, regardless of the species of recombinant α-galactosidase A used for enzyme replacement therapy. A conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay supported the results. Considering these, enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase alpha or agalsidase beta would generate antibodies against the common epitopes in both agalsidase alpha and agalsidase beta. Most of the patients who showed immunopositive reaction exhibited classic Fabry phenotype and harbored gene mutations affecting biosynthesis of α-galactosidase A. As immunochromatography is a handy and simple assay system which can be available at bedside, this assay method would be extremely useful for quick evaluation or first screening of serum antibodies against agalsidase alpha or agalsidase beta in Fabry disease with enzyme replacement therapy.",
        "Despite being the agent of life-threatening meningitis, Neisseria meningitidis is usually carried asymptomatically in the nasopharynx of humans and only occasionally causes disease. The genetic bases for virulence have not been entirely elucidated and the search for new virulence factors in this species is hampered by the lack of an animal model representative of the human disease. As an alternative strategy we employ a molecular epidemiological approach to establish a statistical association of a candidate virulence gene with disease in the human population. We examine the distribution of a previously-identified genetic element, a temperate bacteriophage, in 1288 meningococci isolated from cases of disease and asymptomatic carriage. The phage was over-represented in disease isolates from young adults indicating that it may contribute to invasive disease in this age group. Further statistical analysis indicated that between 20% and 45% of the pathogenic potential of the five most common disease-causing meningococcal groups was linked to the presence of the phage. In the absence of an animal model of human disease, this molecular epidemiological approach permitted the estimation of the influence of the candidate virulence factor. Such an approach is particularly valuable in the investigation of exclusively human diseases.",
        "The genetic basis of haemorrhagic stroke has proved difficult to unravel, partly hampered by the small numbers of subjects in any single study. A meta-analysis of all candidate gene association studies of haemorrhagic stroke (including ruptured subarachnoid haemorrhage and amyloid angiopathy-related haemorrhage) was performed, allowing more reliable estimates of risk.A systematic review and meta-analysis of all genetic studies in haemorrhagic stroke was conducted. Electronic databases were searched until and including March 2007 for any candidate gene in haemorrhagic stroke. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined for each gene disease association using fixed and random effect models.Our meta-analyses included 6,359 cases and 13,805 controls derived from 55 case-control studies, which included 12 genes (13 polymorphisms). Statistically significant associations with haemorrhagic stroke were identified for those homozygous for the ACE/I allele (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.20-1.83; p = 0.0003) and for the 5G allele in the SERPINE1 4G/5G polymorphism (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.03-1.96; p = 0.03). In addition, both epsilon2 and epsilon4 alleles of APOE were significantly associated with lobar haemorrhage (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.26-2.62; p = 0.002 and OR, 1.49; 95% 1.08-2.05; p = 0.01 respectively). Furthermore, a significant protective association against haemorrhagic stroke was found for the factor V Leiden mutation (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.10-0.87; p = 0.03).Our data suggests a genetic contribution to some types of haemorrhagic stroke, with no overall responsible single gene but rather supporting a polygenic aetiology . However, the evidence base is smaller compared to ischaemic stroke. Importantly, for several alleles previously found to be associated with protection from ischaemic stroke, there was a trend towards an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke.",
        "Understanding what constitutes high quality habitat is crucial for the conservation of species, especially those threatened with extinction. Habitat quality frequently is inferred by comparing the attributes of sites where a species is present with those where it is absent. However, species presence may not always indicate high quality habitat. Demographic parameters are likely to provide a more biologically relevant measure of quality, including a species' ability to successfully reproduce. We examined factors believed to influence territory quality for the grey-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis), a cooperatively breeding woodland bird that has experienced major range contraction and population decline in south-eastern Australia. Across three broad regions, we identified active territories and determined the presence of fledglings and the size of family groups, as surrogates of territory quality. These measures were modelled in relation to habitat attributes within territories, the extent of surrounding wooded vegetation, isolation from neighbouring groups, and the size of the neighbourhood population. Fledgling presence was strongly positively associated with group size, indicating that helpers enhance breeding success. Surprisingly, no other territory or landscape-scale variables predicted territory quality, as inferred from either breeding success or group size. Relationships between group size and environmental variables may be obscured by longer-term dynamics in group size. Variation in biotic interactions, notably competition from the noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala), also may contribute. Conservation actions that enhance the number and size of family groups will contribute towards reversing declines of this species. Despite associated challenges, demographic studies have potential to identify mechanistic processes that underpin population performance; critical knowledge for effective conservation management.",
        "Invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells are a T cell subset expressing an invariant T Cell Receptor (TCR) that recognizes glycolipid antigens rather than peptides. The cells have both innate-like rapid cytokine release, and adaptive-like thymic positive selection. iNKT cell activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma and inflammatory diseases, while reduced iNKT cell activation promotes infectious disease, cancer and certain autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Therapeutic means to reduce or deplete iNKT cells could treat inflammatory diseases, while approaches to promote their activation may have potential in certain infectious diseases, cancer or autoimmunity. Thus, we developed invariant TCR-specific monoclonal antibodies to better understand the role of iNKT cells in disease. We report here the first monoclonal antibodies specific for the mouse invariant TCR that by modifying the Fc construct can specifically deplete or activate iNKT cells in vivo in otherwise fully immuno-competent animals. We have used both the depleting and activating version of the antibody in the NOD model of T1D. As demonstrated previously using genetically iNKT cell deficient NOD mice, and in studies of glycolipid antigen activated iNKT cells in standard NOD mice, we found that antibody mediated depletion or activation of iNKT cells respectively accelerated and retarded T1D onset. In BALB/c mice, ovalbumin (OVA) mediated airway hyper-reactivity (AHR) was abrogated with iNKT cell depletion prior to OVA sensitization, confirming studies in knockout mice. Depletion of iNKT cells after sensitization had no effect on AHR in the conducting airways but did reduce AHR in the lung periphery. This result raises caution in the interpretation of studies that use animals that are genetically iNKT cell deficient from birth. These activating and depleting antibodies provide a novel tool to assess the therapeutic potential of iNKT cell manipulation.",
        "How farming systems supply sufficient nitrogen (N) for high yields but with reduced N losses is a central challenge for reducing the tradeoffs often associated with N cycling in agriculture. Variability in soil organic matter and management of organic farms across an agricultural landscape may yield insights for improving N cycling and for evaluating novel indicators of N availability. We assessed yields, plant-soil N cycling, and root expression of N metabolism genes across a representative set of organic fields growing Roma-type tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.) in an intensively-managed agricultural landscape in California, USA. The fields spanned a three-fold range of soil carbon (C) and N but had similar soil types, texture, and pH. Organic tomato yields ranged from 22.9 to 120.1 Mg ha-1 with a mean similar to the county average (86.1 Mg ha-1), which included mostly conventionally-grown tomatoes. Substantial variability in soil inorganic N concentrations, tomato N, and root gene expression indicated a range of possible tradeoffs between yields and potential for N losses across the fields. Fields showing evidence of tightly-coupled plant-soil N cycling, a desirable scenario in which high crop yields are supported by adequate N availability but low potential for N loss, had the highest total and labile soil C and N and received organic matter inputs with a range of N availability. In these fields, elevated expression of a key gene involved in root N assimilation, cytosolic glutamine synthetase GS1, confirmed that plant N assimilation was high even when inorganic N pools were low. Thus tightly-coupled N cycling occurred on several working organic farms. Novel combinations of N cycling indicators (i.e. inorganic N along with soil microbial activity and root gene expression for N assimilation) would support adaptive management for improved N cycling on organic as well as conventional farms, especially when plant-soil N cycling is rapid.",
        "We have previously identified homologs for nearly half of the approximately 30 known yeast Atg's in the genome database of the human sleeping sickness parasite Trypanosoma brucei. So far, only a few of these homologs have their role in autophagy experimentally confirmed. Among the candidates was the ortholog of Atg24 that is involved in pexophagy in yeast. In T. brucei, the peroxisome-like organelles named glycosomes harbor core metabolic processes, especially glycolysis. In the autotrophic yeast, autophagy is essential for adaptation to different nutritional environments by participating in the renewal of the peroxisome population. We hypothesized that autophagic turnover of the parasite's glycosomes plays a role in differentiation during its life cycle, which demands adaptation to different host environments and associated dramatic changes in nutritional conditions. We therefore characterized T. brucei ATG24, the T. brucei ortholog of yeast Atg24 and mammalian SNX4, and found it to have a regulatory role in autophagy and differentiation as well as endocytic trafficking. ATG24 partially localized on endocytic membranes where it was recruited via PI3-kinase III/VPS34. ATG24 silencing severely impaired receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin, but not adsorptive uptake of a lectin, and caused a major enlargement of the flagellar pocket. ATG24 silencing approximately doubled the number of autophagosomes, suggesting a role in repressing autophagy, and strongly accelerated differentiation, in accordance with a role of autophagy in parasite differentiation. Overexpression of the two isoforms of T. brucei ATG8 fused to GFP slowed down differentiation, possibly by a dominant-negative effect. This was overcome by ATG24 depletion, further supporting its regulatory role.",
        "Tiger (Panthera tigris), an endangered species, is under severe threat from poaching, habitat loss, prey depletion and habitat disturbance. Such factors have been reported causing local extermination of tiger populations including in one of the most important reserves in India, namely Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR) in northwestern India. Consequently, tigers were reintroduced in STR between 2008 and 2010, but inadequate breeding success was observed over the years, thus invoking an investigation to ascertain physiological correlates. In the present study, we report glucocorticoid stress responses of the reintroduced tigers in relation to anthropogenic disturbance in the STR from 2011 to 2013. We found anthropogenic disturbance such as encounter rates of livestock and humans, distance to roads and efforts to kill domestic livestock associated with an elevation in fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations in the monitored tigers. In this regard, female tigers seem more sensitive to such disturbance than males. It was possible to discern that tiger's fGCM levels were significantly positively related to the time spent in disturbed areas. Resulting management recommendations include relocation of villages from core areas and restriction of all anthropogenic activities in the entire STR.",
        "The accurate modeling of various features in high energy astrophysical scenarios requires the solution of the Einstein equations together with those of special relativistic hydrodynamics (SRHD). Such models are more complicated than the non-relativistic ones due to the nonlinear relations between the conserved and state variables. A high-resolution shock-capturing central upwind scheme is implemented to solve the given set of equations. The proposed technique uses the precise information of local propagation speeds to avoid the excessive numerical diffusion. The second order accuracy of the scheme is obtained with the use of MUSCL-type initial reconstruction and Runge-Kutta time stepping method. After a discussion of the equations solved and of the techniques employed, a series of one and two-dimensional test problems are carried out. To validate the method and assess its accuracy, the staggered central and the kinetic flux-vector splitting schemes are also applied to the same model. The scheme is robust and efficient. Its results are comparable to those obtained from the sophisticated algorithms, even in the case of highly relativistic two-dimensional test problems.",
        "Capturing human movement patterns across political borders is difficult and this difficulty highlights the need to investigate alternative data streams. With the advent of smart phones and the ability to attach accurate coordinates to Twitter messages, users leave a geographic digital footprint of their movement when posting tweets. In this study we analyzed 10 months of geo-located tweets for Kenya and were able to capture movement of people at different temporal (daily to periodic) and spatial (local, national to international) scales. We were also able to capture both long and short distances travelled, highlighting regional connections and cross-border movement between Kenya and the surrounding countries. The findings from this study has broad implications for studying movement patterns and mapping inter/intra-region movement dynamics.",
        "Matupás are floating vegetation islands found in floodplain lakes of the central Brazilian Amazon. They form initially from the agglomeration of aquatic vegetation, and through time can accumulate a substrate of organic matter sufficient to grow forest patches of several hectares in area and up to 12 m in height. There is little published information on matupás despite their singular characteristics and importance to local fauna and people. In this study we document the traditional ecological knowledge of riverine populations who live near and interact with matupás. We expected that their knowledge, acquired through long term observations and use in different stages of the matupá life cycle, could help clarify various aspects about the ecology and natural history of these islands that field biologists may not have had the opportunity to observe. Research was carried out in five riverine communities of the Amanã Sustainable Development Reserve (Brazil). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 45 inhabitants in order to register local understandings of how matupás are formed, biotic/abiotic factors related to their occurrence, the plants and animals that occur on them, their ecological relevance, and local uses. Local people elucidated several little-known aspects about matupá ecology, especially regarding the importance of seasonal dynamics of high/low water for matupás formation and the relevance of these islands for fish populations. Soil from matupás is especially fertile and is frequently gathered for use in vegetable gardens. In some cases, crops are planted directly onto matupás, representing an incipient agricultural experiment that was previously undocumented in the Amazon. Matupás are also considered a strategic habitat for fishing, mainly for arapaima (Arapaima gigas). The systematic study of traditional ecological knowledge proved to be an important tool for understanding this little-known Amazonian landscape.",
        "Cognitive control (CC) of attention is a major prerequisite for effective information processing. Emotional distractors can bias and impair goal-directed deployment of attentional resources. Frustration-induced negative affect and cognition can act as internal distractors with negative impact on task performance. Consolidation of CC may thus support task-oriented behavior under challenging conditions. Recently, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been put forward as an effective tool to modulate CC. Particularly, anodal, activity enhancing tDCS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) can increase insufficient CC in depression as indicated by a reduction of attentional biases induced by emotionally salient stimuli. With this study, we provide first evidence that, compared to sham stimulation, tDCS to the left dlPFC enhances processing speed measured by an adaptive version of the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT) that is typically thwarted by frustration. Notably, despite an even larger amount of error-related negative feedback, the task-induced upset was suppressed in the group receiving anodal tDCS. Moreover, inhibition of task-related negative affect was correlated with performance gains, suggesting a close link between enhanced processing speed and consolidation of CC by tDCS. Together, these data provide first evidence that activity enhancing anodal tDCS to the left dlPFC can support focused cognitive processing particularly when challenged by frustration-induced negative affect.",
        "Lipid A is a major hydrophobic component of lipopolysaccharides (endotoxin) present in the membrane of most Gram-negative bacteria, and the major responsible for the bioactivity and toxicity of the endotoxin. Previous studies have demonstrated that the late afterglow region of flowing post-discharges at reduced pressure (1-20 Torr) can be used for the sterilization of surfaces and of the reusable medical instrumentation. In the present paper, we show that the antibacterial activity of a pure nitrogen afterglow can essentially be attributed to the large concentrations of nitrogen atoms present in the treatment area and not to the UV radiation of the afterglow. In parallel, the time variation of the inactivation efficiency quantified by the log reduction of the initial Escherichia coli (E. coli) population is correlated with morphologic changes observed on the bacteria by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for increasing afterglow exposure times. The effect of the afterglow exposure is also studied on pure lipid A and on lipid A extracted from exposed E. coli bacteria. We report that more than 60% of lipid A (pure or bacteria-extracted) are lost with the used operating conditions (nitrogen flow QN2 = 1 standard liter per minute (slpm), pressure p = 5 Torr, microwave injected power PMW = 200 W, exposure time: 40 minutes). The afterglow exposure also results in a reduction of the lipid A proinflammatory activity, assessed by the net decrease of the redox-sensitive NFκB transcription factor nuclear translocation in murine aortic endothelial cells stimulated with control vs afterglow-treated (pure and extracted) lipid A. Altogether these results point out the ability of reduced pressure nitrogen afterglows to neutralize the cytotoxic components in Gram-negative bacteria.",
        "The words 'infection' and 'inflammation' lack specific definitions. Here, such words are not defined. Instead, the ability to visualize host-microbial interactions was explored.Leukocyte differential counts and four bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Staphylococcus chromogenes, and Escherichia coli) were determined or isolated in a cross-sectional and randomized study conducted with 611 bovine milk samples. Two paradigms were evaluated: (i) the classic one, which measures non-structured (count or percent) data; and (ii) a method that, using complex data structures, detects and differentiates three-dimensional (3D) interactions among lymphocytes (L), macrophages (M), and neutrophils (N).Classic analyses failed to differentiate bacterial-positive (B+) from -negative (B-) observations: B- and B+ data overlapped, even when statistical significance was achieved. In contrast, the alternative approach showed distinct patterns, such as perpendicular data inflections, which discriminated microbial-negative/mononuclear cell-predominating (MCP) from microbial-positive/phagocyte-predominating (PP) subsets. Two PP subcategories were distinguished, as well as PP/culture-negative (false-negative) and MCP/culture-positive (false-positive) observations. In 3D space, MCP and PP subsets were perpendicular to one another, displaying ≥ 91% specificity or sensitivity. Findings supported five inferences: (i) disease is not always ruled out by negative bacterial tests; (ii) low total cell counts can coexist with high phagocyte percents; (iii) neither positive bacterial isolation nor high cell counts always coincide with PP profiles; (iv) statistical significance is not synonymous with discrimination; and (v) hidden relationships cannot be detected when simple (non-structured) data formats are used and statistical analyses are performed before data subsets are identified, but can be uncovered when complexity is investigated.Pattern recognition-based assessments can detect host-microbial interactions usually unobserved. Such cutoff-free, confidence interval-free, gold standard-free approaches provide interpretable information on complex entities, such as 'infection' and 'inflammation', even without definitions. To investigate disease dynamics, combinations of observational and experimental longitudinal studies, on human and non-human infections, are recommended.",
        "Several meta-analyses confirmed the five most prevalent human papillomavirus (HPV) strains in women with and without cervical neoplastic diseases are HPV16, 18, 31, 52, and 58. HPV16/18 are the predominant oncogenic genotypes, causing approximately 70% of global cervical cancer cases. The vast majority of the women studied in previous analyses were from Europe, North America, Asia, and most recently Latin America and the Caribbean. Despite the high burden of cervical cancer morbidity and mortality in Africa, a robust meta-analysis of HPV genotype prevalence and distribution in African women is lacking.We systematically searched 14 major databases from inception to August 2013 without language restriction, following the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Seventy-one studies from 23 African countries were identified after screening 1162 citations and data abstracted and study quality appraised from 195 articles. HPV type-specific prevalence and distribution was estimated from 17,273 cases of women with normal cervical cytology; 1019 women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS); 1444 women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL); 1571 women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL); and 4,067 cases of invasive cervical carcinoma (ICC). Overall prevalence of HPV16/18 were 4.4% and 2.8% of women with normal cytology, 12.0% and 4.4% with ASCUS, 14.5% and 10.0% with LSIL, 31.2% and 13.9% with HSIL, and 49.7% and 18.0% with ICC, respectively. Study limitations include the lack of adequate data from Middle and Northern African regions, and variations in the HPV type-specific sensitivity of different genotyping protocols.To our knowledge, this study is the most comprehensive assessment of the overall prevalence and distribution of HPV genotypes in African women with and without different cervical neoplasias. We have established that HPV16/18 account for 67.7% of ICC cases among African women. Based on our findings, we highly recommend the administration of existing prophylactic vaccines to younger women not infected with HPV16/18 and an increase in HPV screening efforts for high-risk genotypes to prevent cervical cancer.International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews CRD42013006558.",
        "The marine epiphytic dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus is a toxicologically important genus responsible for ciguatera fish poisoning, the principal cause of non-bacterial illness associated with fish consumption. The genus currently contains species exhibiting either globular or anterior-posteriorly compressed morphologies with marked differences in cell shape and plate arrangement. Here we report a third globular, epiphytic and tychoplanktonic species from the coasts of Ubatuba, Brazil. The new species can be distinguished from G. yasumotoi and G. ruetzleri by its broader first apical plate that occupies a larger portion of the epitheca. Accordingly, phylogenetic trees from small subunit (SSU) and large subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA sequences also showed strongly supported separation of the new species from the G. yasumotoi/G. ruetzleri group albeit with short distance. The molecular phylogenies, which included new sequences of the planktonic species Goniodoma polyedricum, further indicated that the globular species of Gambierdiscus formed a tight clade, clearly separated (with strong bootstrap support) from the clade of lenticular species including the type for Gambierdiscus. The morphological and molecular data in concert support the split of Gambierdiscus sensu lato into two genera. Gambierdiscus sensu stricto should be reserved for the species with lenticular shapes, highly compressed anterioposteriorly, with short-shank fishhook apical pore plate, large 2' plate, low and ascending cingular displacement, and pouch-like sulcal morphology. The new genus name Fukuyoa gen. nov. should be applied to the globular species, slightly laterally compressed, with long-shank fishhook apical pore plate, large 1' plate, greater and descending cingular displacement, and not pouch-like vertically-oriented sulcal morphology. Fukuyoa contains the new species Fukuyoa paulensis gen. et sp. nov., and F. yasumotoi comb. nov. and F. ruetzleri comb. nov.",
        "The surgical repair of heart and vascular disease often requires implanting synthetic grafts. While synthetic grafts have been successfully used for medium-to-large sized arteries, applications for small diameter arteries (<6 mm) is limited due to high rates of occlusion by thrombosis. Our objective was to develop a tissue engineered vascular graft (TEVG) for small diameter arteries. TEVGs composed of polylactic acid nanofibers with inner luminal diameter between 0.5 and 0.6 mm were surgically implanted as infra-renal aortic interposition conduits in 25 female C17SCID/bg mice. Twelve mice were given sham operations. Survival of mice with TEVG grafts was 91.6% at 12 months post-implantation (sham group: 83.3%). No instances of graft stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation were observed over 12 months post-implantation, assessed by Doppler ultrasound and microCT. Histologic analysis of explanted TEVG grafts showed presence of CD31-positive endothelial monolayer and F4/80-positive macrophages after 4, 8, and 12 months in vivo. Cells positive for α-smooth muscle actin were observed within TEVG, demonstrating presence of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Neo-extracellular matrix consisting mostly of collagen types I and III were observed at 12 months post-implantation. PCR analysis supports histological observations. TEVG group showed significant increases in expressions of SMC marker, collagen-I and III, matrix metalloproteinases-2 and 9, and itgam (a macrophage marker), when compared to sham group. Overall, patency rates were excellent at 12 months after implantation, as structural integrity of these TEVG. Tissue analysis also demonstrated vessel remodeling by autologous cell.",
        "Executive functions (EFs) training interventions aimed at ADHD-symptom reduction have yielded mixed results. Generally, these interventions focus on training a single cognitive domain (e.g., working memory [WM], inhibition, or cognitive-flexibility). However, evidence suggests that most children with ADHD show deficits on multiple EFs, and that these EFs are largely related to different brain regions. Therefore, training multiple EFs might be a potentially more effective strategy to reduce EF-related ADHD symptoms.Eighty-nine children with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD (aged 8-12) were randomized to either a full-active-condition where visuospatial WM, inhibition and cognitive-flexibility were trained, a partially-active-condition where inhibition and cognitive-flexibility were trained and the WM-training task was presented in placebo-mode, or to a full placebo-condition. Short-term and long-term (3-months) effects of this gamified, 25-session, home-based computer-training were evaluated on multiple outcome domains.During training compliance was high (only 3% failed to meet compliance criteria). After training, only children in the full-active condition showed improvement on measures of visuospatial short-term-memory (STM) and WM. Inhibitory performance and interference control only improved in the full-active- and the partially-active condition. No Treatment-condition x Time interactions were found for cognitive-flexibility, verbal WM, complex-reasoning, nor for any parent-, teacher-, or child-rated ADHD behaviors, EF-behaviors, motivational behaviors, or general problem behaviors. Nonetheless, almost all measures showed main Time-effects, including the teacher-ratings.Improvements on inhibition and visuospatial STM and WM were specifically related to the type of treatment received. However, transfer to untrained EFs and behaviors was mostly nonspecific (i.e., only interference control improved exclusively in the two EF training conditions). As such, in this multiple EF-training, mainly nonspecific treatment factors - as opposed to the specific effects of training EFs-seem related to far transfer effects found on EF and behavior.trialregister.nl NTR2728.

        "Serum N-glycans have been identified as putative biomarkers for numerous diseases. The impact of different serum sample tubes and processing methods on N-glycan analysis has received relatively little attention. This study aimed to determine the effect of different sample tubes and processing methods on the whole serum N-glycan profile in both health and disease. A secondary objective was to describe a robot automated N-glycan release, labeling and cleanup process for use in a biomarker discovery system.25 patients with active and quiescent inflammatory bowel disease and controls had three different serum sample tubes taken at the same draw. Two different processing methods were used for three types of tube (with and without gel-separation medium). Samples were randomised and processed in a blinded fashion. Whole serum N-glycan release, 2-aminobenzamide labeling and cleanup was automated using a Hamilton Microlab STARlet Liquid Handling robot. Samples were analysed using a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography/ethylene bridged hybrid(BEH) column on an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography instrument. Data were analysed quantitatively by pairwise correlation and hierarchical clustering using the area under each chromatogram peak. Qualitatively, a blinded assessor attempted to match chromatograms to each individual.There was small intra-individual variation in serum N-glycan profiles from samples collected using different sample processing methods. Intra-individual correlation coefficients were between 0.99 and 1. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering and principal coordinate analyses accurately matched samples from the same individual. Qualitative analysis demonstrated good chromatogram overlay and a blinded assessor was able to accurately match individuals based on chromatogram profile, regardless of disease status.The three different serum sample tubes processed using the described methods cause minimal inter-individual variation in serum whole N-glycan profile when processed using an automated workstream. This has important implications for N-glycan biomarker discovery studies using different serum processing standard operating procedures.",
        "Plasmodium knowlesi is a newly described zoonosis that causes malaria in the human population that can be severe and fatal. The study of P. knowlesi parasites from human clinical isolates is relatively new and, in order to obtain maximum information from patient sample collections, we explored the possibility of generating P. knowlesi genome sequences from archived clinical isolates. Our patient sample collection consisted of frozen whole blood samples that contained excessive human DNA contamination and, in that form, were not suitable for parasite genome sequencing. We developed a method to reduce the amount of human DNA in the thawed blood samples in preparation for high throughput parasite genome sequencing using Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq sequencing platforms. Seven of fifteen samples processed had sufficiently pure P. knowlesi DNA for whole genome sequencing. The reads were mapped to the P. knowlesi H strain reference genome and an average mapping of 90% was obtained. Genes with low coverage were removed leaving 4623 genes for subsequent analyses. Previously we identified a DNA sequence dimorphism on a small fragment of the P. knowlesi normocyte binding protein xa gene on chromosome 14. We used the genome data to assemble full-length Pknbpxa sequences and discovered that the dimorphism extended along the gene. An in-house algorithm was developed to detect SNP sites co-associating with the dimorphism. More than half of the P. knowlesi genome was dimorphic, involving genes on all chromosomes and suggesting that two distinct types of P. knowlesi infect the human population in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. We use P. knowlesi clinical samples to demonstrate that Plasmodium DNA from archived patient samples can produce high quality genome data. We show that analyses, of even small numbers of difficult clinical malaria isolates, can generate comprehensive genomic information that will improve our understanding of malaria parasite diversity and pathobiology.",
        "Scavenger receptor associated with endothelial cells I (SREC-I) was shown to be expressed in immune cells and to play a role in the endocytosis of peptides and antigen presentation. As our previous studies indicated that SREC-I required intact Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression for its functions in tumor immunity, we examined potential interactions between these two receptors. We have shown here that SREC-I became associated with TLR4 on binding bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in RAW 264.7 and HEK 293 cells overexpressing these two receptors. The receptors then became internalized together in intracellular endosomes. SREC-I promoted TLR4-induced signal transduction through the NF-kB and MAP kinase pathways, leading to enhanced inflammatory cytokine release. Activation of inflammatory signaling through SREC-I/TLR4 complexes appeared to involve recruitment of the receptors into detergent-insoluble, cholesterol-rich lipid microdomains that contained the small GTPase Cdc42 and the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-src. Under conditions of SREC-I activation by LPS, TLR4 activity required Cdc42 as well as cholesterol and actin polymerization for signaling through NF-kB and MAP kinase pathways in RAW 264.7 cells. SREC-I appeared to respond differently to another ligand, the molecular chaperone Hsp90 that, while triggering SREC-I-TLR4 binding caused only faint activation of the NF-kB pathway. Our experiments therefore indicated that SREC-I could bind LPS and might be involved in innate inflammatory immune responses to extracellular danger signals in RAW 264.7 cells or bone marrow-derived macrophages.",
        "The biology of modern Conidae (cone snails)--which includes the hyperdiverse genus Conus--has been intensively studied, but the fossil record of the clade remains poorly understood, particularly within an evolutionary framework. Here, ultraviolet light is used to reveal and characterize the original shell coloration patterns of 28 species of cone snails from three Neogene coral reef-associated deposits from the Cibao Valley, northern Dominican Republic. These fossils come from the upper Miocene Cercado Fm. and lower Pliocene Gurabo Fm., and range in age from about 6.6-4.8 Ma. Comparison of the revealed coloration patterns with those of extant species allow the taxa to be assigned to three genera of cone snails (Profundiconus, Conasprella, and Conus) and at least nine subgenera. Thirteen members of these phylogenetically diverse reef faunas are described as new species. These include: Profundiconus? hennigi, Conasprella (Ximeniconus) ageri, Conus anningae, Conus lyelli, Conus (Atlanticonus?) franklinae, Conus (Stephanoconus) gouldi, Conus (Stephanoconus) bellacoensis, Conus (Ductoconus) cashi, Conus (Dauciconus) garrisoni, Conus (Dauciconus?) zambaensis, Conus (Spuriconus?) kaesleri, Conus (Spuriconus?) lombardii, and Conus (Lautoconus?) carlottae. Each of the three reef deposits contain a minimum of 14-16 cone snail species, levels of diversity that are similar to modern Indo-Pacific reef systems. Finally, most of the 28 species can be assigned to modern clades and thus have important implications for understanding the biogeographic and temporal histories of these clades in tropical America.",
        "To analyse the diagnostic signs present in slices of human breast tumour specimens using synchrotron radiation phase-contrast imaging computed tomography (PCI-CT) for the first time and assess the feasibility of this technique for clinical applications.The ethics committee of our university and relevant clinical hospital approved this prospective study, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. PCI-CT of human breast tumour specimens with synchrotron radiation was performed at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). A total of 14 specimens of early-stage carcinomas and 8 specimens of adenomas were enrolled. Based on raw data reconstruction, the diagnostic signs present in the slices were analysed and correlated with histopathology. We proposed a criterion for clinical diagnosis according to the evaluated signs and the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) for reference. The criterion was then assessed by clinicians in a double-blind method. Finally, descriptive statistics were evaluated, depending on the assessment results.The 14 carcinoma specimens and 8 adenoma specimens were diagnosed as malignant and benign tumours, respectively. The total coincidence rate was 100%.Our study results demonstrate that the X-ray diagnostic signs observed in the specimen slices and the criterion used for clinical diagnosis were accurate and reliable. The criterion based on signs analysis can be used to differentiate early-stage benign or malignant tumours. As a promising imaging method, PCI-CT can serve as a possible and feasible supplement to BI-RADS in the future.",
        "The methods currently available to deliver functional labels and drugs to the cell cytosol are inefficient and this constitutes a major obstacle to cell biology (delivery of sensors and imaging probes) and therapy (drug access to the cell internal machinery). As cell membranes are impermeable to most molecular cargos, viral peptides have been used to bolster their internalisation through endocytosis and help their release to the cytosol by bursting the endosomal vesicles. However, conflicting results have been reported on the extent of the cytosolic delivery achieved. To evaluate their potential, we used gold nanoparticles as model cargos and systematically assessed how the functionalisation of their surface by either or both of the viral peptides TAT and HA2 influenced their intracellular delivery. We evaluated the number of gold nanoparticles present in cells after internalisation using photothermal microscopy and their subcellular localisation by electron microscopy. While their uptake increased when the TAT and/or HA2 viral peptides were present on their surface, we did not observe a significant cytosolic delivery of the gold nanoparticles.",
        "DNA methylation is reprogrammed during early embryogenesis by active and passive mechanisms in advance of the first differentiation event producing the embryonic and extraembryonic lineage cells which contribute to the future embryo proper and to the placenta respectively. Embryonic lineage cells re-acquire a highly methylated genome dependent on the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b that are required for de novo methylation. By contrast, extraembryonic lineage cells remain globally hypomethylated but the mechanisms that underlie this hypomethylation remain unknown.We have employed an inducible system that supports differentiation between these two lineages and recapitulates the DNA methylation asymmetry generated in vivo. We find that in vitro down-regulation of Oct3/4 in ES cells recapitulates the decline in global DNA methylation associated with trophoblast. The de novo DNMTs Dnmt3a2 and Dnmt3b are down-regulated during trophoblast differentiation. Dnmt1, which is responsible for maintenance methylation, is expressed comparably in embryonic and trophoblast lineages, however importantly in trophoblast giant cells Dnmt1fails to be attracted to replication foci, thus allowing loss of DNA methylation while implicating a passive demethylation mechanism. Interestingly, Dnmt1 localization was restored by exogenous Np95/Uhrf1, a Dnmt1 chaperone required for Dnmt1-targeting to replication foci, yet DNA methylation levels remained low. Over-expression of de novo DNMTs also failed to increase DNA methylation in target sequences.We propose that induced trophoblast cells may have a mechanism to resist genome-wide increases of DNA methylation, thus reinforcing the genome-wide epigenetic distinctions between the embryonic and extraembryonic lineages in the mouse. This resistance may be based on transcription factors or on global differences in chromatin structure.",
        "Infection in pregnancy may be involved in the aetiology of pre-eclampsia. However, a clear association between acute maternal infection and pre-eclampsia has not been established. We assessed whether acute urinary tract infection, respiratory tract infection, and antibiotic drug prescriptions in pregnancy (a likely proxy for maternal infection) are associated with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia.We used a matched nested case-control design and data from the UK General Practice Research Database to examine the association between maternal infection and pre-eclampsia. Primiparous women aged at least 13 years and registered with a participating practice between January 1987 and October 2007 were eligible for inclusion. We selected all cases of pre-eclampsia and a random sample of primiparous women without pre-eclampsia (controls). Cases (n=1533) were individually matched with up to ten controls (n=14236) on practice and year of delivery. We calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for pre-eclampsia comparing women exposed and unexposed to infection using multivariable conditional logistic regression. After adjusting for maternal age, pre-gestational hypertension, diabetes, renal disease and multifetal gestation, the odds of pre-eclampsia were increased in women prescribed antibiotic drugs (adjusted odds ratio 1.28;1.14-1.44) and in women with urinary tract infection (adjusted odds ratio 1.22;1.03-1.45). We found no association with maternal respiratory tract infection (adjusted odds ratio 0.91;0.72-1.16). Further adjustment for maternal smoking and pre-pregnancy body mass index made no difference to our findings.Women who acquire a urinary infection during pregnancy, but not those who have a respiratory infection, are at an increased risk of pre-eclampsia. Maternal antibiotic prescriptions are also associated with an increased risk. Further research is required to elucidate the underlying mechanism of this association and to determine whether, among women who acquire infections in pregnancy, prompt treatment or prophylaxis against infection might reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia.",
        "α-Synuclein is a small protein strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders. We report here the use of in-cell NMR spectroscopy to observe directly the structure and dynamics of this protein within E. coli cells. To improve the accuracy in the measurement of backbone chemical shifts within crowded in-cell NMR spectra, we have developed a deconvolution method to reduce inhomogeneous line broadening within cellular samples. The resulting chemical shift values were then used to evaluate the distribution of secondary structure populations which, in the absence of stable tertiary contacts, are a most effective way to describe the conformational fluctuations of disordered proteins. The results indicate that, at least within the bacterial cytosol, α-synuclein populates a highly dynamic state that, despite the highly crowded environment, has the same characteristics as the disordered monomeric form observed in aqueous solution.",
        "Advancements in knowledge of obesity aetiology and mobile phone technology have created the opportunity to develop an electronic tool to predict an infant's risk of childhood obesity. The study aims were to develop and validate equations for the prediction of childhood obesity and integrate them into a mobile phone application (App).Anthropometry and childhood obesity risk data were obtained for 1868 UK-born White or South Asian infants in the Born in Bradford cohort. Logistic regression was used to develop prediction equations (at 6 ± 1.5, 9 ± 1.5 and 12 ± 1.5 months) for risk of childhood obesity (BMI at 2 years >91(st) centile and weight gain from 0-2 years >1 centile band) incorporating sex, birth weight, and weight gain as predictors. The discrimination accuracy of the equations was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC); internal validity by comparing area under the curve to those obtained in bootstrapped samples; and external validity by applying the equations to an external sample. An App was built to incorporate six final equations (two at each age, one of which included maternal BMI). The equations had good discrimination (AUCs 86-91%), with the addition of maternal BMI marginally improving prediction. The AUCs in the bootstrapped and external validation samples were similar to those obtained in the development sample. The App is user-friendly, requires a minimum amount of information, and provides a risk assessment of low, medium, or high accompanied by advice and website links to government recommendations.Prediction equations for risk of childhood obesity have been developed and incorporated into a novel App, thereby providing proof of concept that childhood obesity prediction research can be integrated with advancements in technology.",
        "Multivariate analysis is a very general and powerful technique for analysing Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. An outstanding problem however is how to make inferences that are consistent over a group of subjects as to whether there are condition-specific differences in data features, and what are those features that maximise these differences. Here we propose a solution based on Canonical Variates Analysis (CVA) model scoring at the subject level and random effects Bayesian model selection at the group level. We apply this approach to beamformer reconstructed MEG data in source space. CVA estimates those multivariate patterns of activation that correlate most highly with the experimental design; the order of a CVA model is then determined by the number of significant canonical vectors. Random effects Bayesian model comparison then provides machinery for inferring the optimal order over the group of subjects. Absence of a multivariate dependence is indicated by the null model being the most likely. This approach can also be applied to CVA models with a fixed number of canonical vectors but supplied with different feature sets. We illustrate the method by identifying feature sets based on variable-dimension MEG power spectra in the primary visual cortex and fusiform gyrus that are maximally discriminative of data epochs before versus after visual stimulation.",
        "Advances in next-generation sequencing technology have enabled systematic exploration of the contribution of rare variation to Mendelian and complex diseases. Although it is well known that population stratification can generate spurious associations with common alleles, its impact on rare variant association methods remains poorly understood. Here, we performed exhaustive coalescent simulations with demographic parameters calibrated from exome sequence data to evaluate the performance of nine rare variant association methods in the presence of fine-scale population structure. We find that all methods have an inflated spurious association rate for parameter values that are consistent with levels of differentiation typical of European populations. For example, at a nominal significance level of 5%, some test statistics have a spurious association rate as high as 40%. Finally, we empirically assess the impact of population stratification in a large data set of 4,298 European American exomes. Our results have important implications for the design, analysis, and interpretation of rare variant genome-wide association studies.",
        "In humans, dopamine is implicated in reward and risk-based decision-making. However, the specific effects of dopamine augmentation on risk evaluation are unclear. Here we sought to measure the effect of 100 mg oral levodopa, which enhances synaptic release of dopamine, on choice behaviour in healthy humans. We use a paradigm without feedback or learning, which solely isolates effects on risk evaluation. We present two studies (n = 20; n = 20) employing a randomised, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design. We manipulated different dimensions of risk in a controlled economic paradigm. We test effects on risk-reward tradeoffs, assaying both aversion to variance (the spread of possible outcomes) and preference for relative losses and gains (asymmetry of outcomes--skewness), dissociating this from potential non-specific effects on choice randomness using behavioural modelling. There were no systematic effects of levodopa on risk attitudes, either for variance or skewness. However, there was a drift towards more risk-averse behaviour over time, indicating that this paradigm was sensitive to detect changes in risk-preferences. These findings suggest that levodopa administration does not change the evaluation of risk. One possible reason is that dopaminergic influences on decision making may be due to changing the response to reward feedback.",
        "Mortality from bacterial meningitis in African adults is significantly higher than those in better resourced settings and adjunctive therapeutic interventions such as dexamethasone and glycerol have been shown to be ineffective. We conducted a study analysing data from clinical trials of bacterial meningitis in Blantyre, Malawi to investigate the clinical parameters associated with this high mortality.We searched for all clinical trials undertaken in Blantyre investigating bacterial meningitis from 1990 to the current time and combined the data from all included trial datasets into one database. We used logistic regression to relate individual clinical parameters to mortality. Adults with community acquired bacterial meningitis were included if the CSF culture isolate was consistent with meningitis or if the CSF white cell count was >100 cells/mm(3) (>50% neutrophils) in HIV negative participants and >5 cells/mm(3) in HIV positive participants. Outcome was measured by mortality at discharge from hospital (after 10 days of antibiotic therapy) and community follow up (day 40).Seven hundred and fifteen episodes of bacterial meningitis were evaluated. The mortality rate was 45% at day 10 and 54% at day 40. The most common pathogens were S.pneumoniae (84% of positive CSF isolates) and N.meningitidis (4%). 607/694 (87%) participants tested were HIV antibody positive. Treatment delays within the hospital system were marked. The median presenting GCS was 12/15, 17% had GCS<8 and 44.9% had a seizure during the illness. Coma, seizures, tachycardia and anaemia were all significantly associated with mortality on multivariate analysis. HIV status and pneumococcal culture positivity in the CSF were not associated with mortality. Adults with community acquired bacterial meningitis in Malawi present with a severe clinical phenotype. Predictors of high mortality are different to those seen in Western settings. Optimising in-hospital care and minimising treatment delays presents an opportunity to improve outcomes considerably.",
        "Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) measured with Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) is a powerful technique to investigate spatio-temporal regulation of protein-protein interactions in living cells. When using standard fitting methods to analyze time domain FLIM, the correct estimation of the FRET parameters requires a high number of photons and therefore long acquisition times which are incompatible with the observation of dynamic protein-protein interactions. Recently, non-fitting strategies have been developed for the analysis of FLIM images: the polar plot or \"phasor\" and the minimal fraction of interacting donor mfD . We propose here a novel non-fitting strategy based on the calculation of moments. We then compare the performance of these three methods when shortening the acquisition time: either by reducing the number of counted photons N or the number of temporal channels Nch , which is particularly adapted for the original fast-FLIM prototype presented in this work that employs the time gated approach. Based on theoretical calculations, Monte Carlo simulations and experimental data, we determine the domain of validity of each method. We thus demonstrate that the polar approach remains accurate for a large range of conditions (low N, Nch or small fractions of interacting donor fD ). The validity domain of the moments method is more restricted (not applicable when fD <0.25 or when Nch  = 4) but it is more precise than the polar approach. We also demonstrate that the mfD is robust in all conditions and it is the most precise strategy; although it does not strictly provide the fraction of interacting donor. We show using the fast-FLIM prototype (with an acquisition rate up to 1 Hz) that these non-fitting strategies are very powerful for on-line analysis on a standard computer and thus for quantifying automatically the spatio-temporal activation of Rac-GTPase in living cells by FRET.",
        "Mutations within the NOTCH3 gene cause cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). CADASIL mutations appear to be restricted to the first twenty-four exons, resulting in the gain or loss of a cysteine amino acid. The role of other exonic NOTCH3 variation not involving cysteine residues and mutations in exons 25-33 in ischemic stroke remains unresolved.All 33 exons of NOTCH3 were sequenced in 269 Caucasian probands from the Siblings With Ischemic Stroke Study (SWISS), a 70-center North American affected sibling pair study and 95 healthy Caucasian control subjects. Variants identified by sequencing in the SWISS probands were then tested for association with ischemic stroke using US Caucasian controls collected at the Mayo Clinic (n=654), and further assessed in a Caucasian (n=802) and African American (n=298) patient-control series collected through the Ischemic Stroke Genetics Study (ISGS).Sequencing of the 269 SWISS probands identified one (0.4%) with small vessel type stroke carrying a known CADASIL mutation (p.R558C; Exon 11). Of the 19 common NOTCH3 variants identified, the only variant significantly associated with ischemic stroke after multiple testing adjustment was p.R1560P (rs78501403; Exon 25) in the combined SWISS and ISGS Caucasian series (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.50, P=0.0022) where presence of the minor allele was protective against ischemic stroke. Although only significant prior to adjustment for multiple testing, p.T101T (rs3815188; Exon 3) was associated with an increased risk of small-vessel stroke (OR: 1.56, P=0.008) and p.P380P (rs61749020; Exon 7) was associated with decreased risk of large-vessel stroke (OR: 0.35, P=0.047) in Caucasians. No significant associations were observed in the small African American series.Cysteine-affecting NOTCH3 mutations are rare in patients with typical ischemic stroke, however our observation that common NOTCH3 variants may be associated with risk of ischemic stroke warrants further study.",
        "An up-to-date and reliable map of podoconiosis is needed to design geographically targeted and cost-effective intervention in Ethiopia. Identifying the ecological correlates of the distribution of podoconiosis is the first step for distribution and risk maps. The objective of this study was to investigate the spatial distribution and ecological correlates of podoconiosis using historical and contemporary survey data.Data on the observed prevalence of podoconiosis were abstracted from published and unpublished literature into a standardized database, according to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. In total, 10 studies conducted between 1969 and 2012 were included, and data were available for 401,674 individuals older than 15 years of age from 229 locations. A range of high resolution environmental factors were investigated to determine their association with podoconiosis prevalence, using logistic regression.The prevalence of podoconiosis in Ethiopia was estimated at 3.4% (95% CI 3.3%-3.4%) with marked regional variation. We identified significant associations between mean annual Land Surface Temperature (LST), mean annual precipitation, topography of the land and fine soil texture and high prevalence of podoconiosis. The derived maps indicate both widespread occurrence of podoconiosis and a marked variability in prevalence of podoconiosis, with prevalence typically highest at altitudes >1500 m above sea level (masl), with >1500 mm annual rainfall and mean annual LST of 19-21°C. No (or very little) podoconiosis occurred at altitudes <1225 masl, with annual rainfall <900 mm, and mean annual LST of >24°C.Podoconiosis remains a public health problem in Ethiopia over considerable areas of the country, but exhibits marked geographical variation associated in part with key environmental factors. This is work in progress and the results presented here will be refined in future work.",
        "Accurate associative learning is often hindered by confirmation bias and success-chasing, which together can conspire to produce or solidify false beliefs in the decision-maker. We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging in 35 experienced physicians, while they learned to choose between two treatments in a series of virtual patient encounters. We estimated a learning model for each subject based on their observed behavior and this model divided clearly into high performers and low performers. The high performers showed small, but equal learning rates for both successes (positive outcomes) and failures (no response to the drug). In contrast, low performers showed very large and asymmetric learning rates, learning significantly more from successes than failures; a tendency that led to sub-optimal treatment choices. Consistently with these behavioral findings, high performers showed larger, more sustained BOLD responses to failed vs. successful outcomes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule while low performers displayed the opposite response profile. Furthermore, participants' learning asymmetry correlated with anticipatory activation in the nucleus accumbens at trial onset, well before outcome presentation. Subjects with anticipatory activation in the nucleus accumbens showed more success-chasing during learning. These results suggest that high performers' brains achieve better outcomes by attending to informative failures during training, rather than chasing the reward value of successes. The differential brain activations between high and low performers could potentially be developed into biomarkers to identify efficient learners on novel decision tasks, in medical or other contexts.",
        "Treatment seeking delays among people living with HIV have adverse consequences for outcome. Gender differences in treatment outcomes have been observed in sub-Saharan Africa.To better understand antiretroviral treatment (ART) seeking behaviour in HIV-infected adults in rural Malawi.Qualitative interviews with male and female participants in an ART cohort study at a treatment site in rural northern Malawi triangulated with analysis of baseline clinical and demographic data for 365 individuals attending sequentially for ART screening between January 2008 and September 2009.43% of the cohort presented with late stage HIV disease classified as WHO stage 3/4. Respondents reported that women's frequency of testing, health awareness and commitment to children led to earlier ART uptake and that men's commitment to wider social networks of influence, masculine ideals of strength, and success with sexual and marital partners led them to refuse treatment until they were sick. Quantitative analysis of the screening cohort provided supporting evidence for these expressed views. Overall, male gender (adjusted OR 2.3, 95% CI1.3-3.9) and never being married (adjusted OR 4.1, 95% CI1.5-11.5) were risk factors for late presentation, whereas having ≥3 dependent children was associated with earlier presentation (adjusted OR 0.31, 95% CI0.15-0.63), compared to those with no dependent children.Gender-specific barriers and facilitators operate throughout the whole process of seeking care. Further efforts to enrol men into care earlier should focus on the masculine characteristics that they value, and the risks to these of severe health decline. Our results emphasise the value of exploring as well as identifying behavioural correlates of late presentation.",
        "Early start of enteral feeding is an established treatment strategy in intubated patients in intensive care since it reduces invasive bacterial infections and length of hospital stay. There is equipoise whether early enteral feeding is also beneficial in non-intubated patients with cerebral malaria in resource poor settings. We hypothesized that the risk of aspiration pneumonia might outweigh the potential benefits of earlier recovery and prevention of hypoglycaemia.A randomized trial of early (day of admission) versus late (after 60 hours in adults or 36 hours in children) start of enteral feeding was undertaken in patients with cerebral malaria in Chittagong, Bangladesh from May 2008 to August 2009. The primary outcome measures were incidence of aspiration pneumonia, hypoglycaemia and coma recovery time. The trial was terminated after inclusion of 56 patients because of a high incidence of aspiration pneumonia in the early feeding group (9/27 (33%)), compared to the late feeding group (0/29 (0%)), p = 0.001). One patient in the late feeding group, and none in the early group, had hypoglycaemia during admission. There was no significant difference in overall mortality (9/27 (33%) vs 6/29 (21%), p = 0.370), but mortality was 5/9 (56%) in patients with aspiration pneumonia.In conclusion, early start of enteral feeding is detrimental in non-intubated patients with cerebral malaria in many resource-poor settings. Evidence gathered in resource rich settings is not necessarily transferable to resource-poor settings.Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN57488577.",
        "In severe asthma, bronchodilator- and steroid-insensitive airflow obstruction develops through unknown mechanisms characterized by increased lung airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass and stiffness. We explored the role of a Regulator of G-protein Signaling protein (RGS4) in the ASM hyperplasia and reduced contractile capacity characteristic of advanced asthma. Using immunocytochemical staining, ASM expression of RGS4 was determined in endobronchial biopsies from healthy subjects and those from subjects with mild, moderate and severe asthma. Cell proliferation assays, agonist-induced calcium mobilization and bronchoconstriction were determined in cultured human ASM cells and in human precision cut lung slices. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches, the precise role of RGS proteins was determined in stimulating human ASM proliferation and inhibiting bronchoconstriction. RGS4 expression was restricted to a subpopulation of ASM and was specifically upregulated by mitogens, which induced a hyperproliferative and hypocontractile ASM phenotype similar to that observed in recalcitrant asthma. RGS4 expression was markedly increased in bronchial smooth muscle of patients with severe asthma, and expression correlated significantly with reduced pulmonary function. Whereas RGS4 inhibited G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated bronchoconstriction, unexpectedly RGS4 was required for PDGF-induced proliferation and sustained activation of PI3K, a mitogenic signaling molecule that regulates ASM proliferation. These studies indicate that increased RGS4 expression promotes a phenotypic switch of ASM, evoking irreversible airway obstruction in subjects with severe asthma.",
        "Diagnostic information for psychiatric research often depends on both clinical interviews and medical records. Although discrepancies between these two sources are well known, there have been few studies into the degree and origins of inconsistencies.We compared data from structured interviews and medical records on 1,970 Han Chinese women with recurrent DSM-IV major depression (MD). Correlations were high for age at onset of MD (0.93) and number of episodes (0.70), intermediate for family history (+0.62) and duration of longest episode (+0.43) and variable but generally more modest for individual depressive symptoms (mean kappa = 0.32). Four factors were identified for twelve symptoms from medical records and the same four factors emerged from analysis of structured interviews. Factor congruencies were high but the correlation of factors between interviews and records were modest (i.e. +0.2 to +0.4).Structured interviews and medical records are highly concordant for age of onset, and the number and length of episodes, but agree more modestly for individual symptoms and symptom factors. The modesty of these correlations probably arises from multiple factors including i) inconsistency in the definition of the worst episode, ii) inaccuracies in self-report and iii) difficulties in coding medical records where symptoms were recorded solely for clinical purposes.",
        "In medical practice, diagnostic hypotheses are often made by physicians in the first moments of contact with patients; sometimes even before they report their symptoms. We propose that generation of diagnostic hypotheses in this context is the result of cognitive processes subserved by brain mechanisms that are similar to those involved in naming objects or concepts in everyday life.To test this proposal we developed an experimental paradigm with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using radiological diagnosis as a model. Twenty-five radiologists diagnosed lesions in chest X-ray images and named non-medical targets (animals) embedded in chest X-ray images while being scanned in a fMRI session. Images were presented for 1.5 seconds; response times (RTs) and the ensuing cortical activations were assessed. The mean response time for diagnosing lesions was 1.33 (SD ±0.14) seconds and 1.23 (SD ±0.13) seconds for naming animals. 72% of the radiologists reported cogitating differential diagnoses during trials (3.5 seconds). The overall pattern of cortical activations was remarkably similar for both types of targets. However, within the neural systems shared by both stimuli, activation was significantly greater in left inferior frontal sulcus and posterior cingulate cortex for lesions relative to animals.Generation of diagnostic hypotheses and differential diagnoses made through the immediate visual recognition of clinical signs can be a fast and automatic process. The co-localization of significant brain activation for lesions and animals suggests that generating diagnostic hypotheses for lesions and naming animals are served by the same neuronal systems. Nevertheless, diagnosing lesions was cognitively more demanding and associated with more activation in higher order cortical areas. These results support the hypothesis that medical diagnoses based on prompt visual recognition of clinical signs and naming in everyday life are supported by similar brain systems.",
        "To understand how miRNAs contribute to the molecular phenotype of adipose tissues and related traits, we performed global miRNA expression profiling in subcutaneous abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue of 70 human subjects and characterised which miRNAs were differentially expressed between these tissues. We found that 12% of the miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue (FDR adjusted p<0.05) in the primary study, of which 59 replicated in a follow-up study of 40 additional subjects. Further, 14 miRNAs were found to be associated with metabolic syndrome case-control status in abdominal tissue and three of these replicated (primary study: FDR adjusted p<0.05, replication: p<0.05 and directionally consistent effect). Genome-wide genotyping was performed in the 70 subjects to enable miRNA expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis. Candidate miRNA eQTLs were followed-up in the additional 40 subjects and six significant, independent cis-located miRNA eQTLs (primary study: p<0.001; replication: p<0.05 and directionally consistent effect) were identified. Finally, global mRNA expression profiling was performed in both tissues to enable association analysis between miRNA and target mRNA expression levels. We find 22% miRNAs in abdominal and 9% miRNAs in gluteal adipose tissue with expression levels significantly associated with the expression of corresponding target mRNAs (FDR adjusted p<0.05). Taken together, our results indicate a clear difference in the miRNA molecular phenotypic profile of abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue, that the expressions of some miRNAs are influenced by cis-located genetic variants and that miRNAs are associated with expression levels of their predicted mRNA targets.",
        "Our understanding of the composition of multi-clonal malarial infections and the epidemiological factors which shape their diversity remain poorly understood. Traditionally within-host diversity has been defined in terms of the multiplicity of infection (MOI) derived by PCR-based genotyping. Massively parallel, single molecule sequencing technologies now enable individual read counts to be derived on genome-wide datasets facilitating the development of new statistical approaches to describe within-host diversity. In this class of measures the F(WS) metric characterizes within-host diversity and its relationship to population level diversity. Utilizing P. falciparum field isolates from patients in West Africa we here explore the relationship between the traditional MOI and F(WS) approaches. F(WS) statistics were derived from read count data at 86,158 SNPs in 64 samples sequenced on the Illumina GA platform. MOI estimates were derived by PCR at the msp-1 and -2 loci. Significant correlations were observed between the two measures, particularly with the msp-1 locus (P = 5.92×10(-5)). The F(WS) metric should be more robust than the PCR-based approach owing to reduced sensitivity to potential locus-specific artifacts. Furthermore the F(WS) metric captures information on a range of parameters which influence out-crossing risk including the number of clones (MOI), their relative proportions and genetic divergence. This approach should provide novel insights into the factors which correlate with, and shape within-host diversity.",
        "We have examined the transcriptional response of Caenorhabditis elegans following exposure to the anthelmintic drug ivermectin (IVM) using whole genome microarrays and real-time QPCR. Our original aim was to identify candidate molecules involved in IVM metabolism and/or excretion. For this reason the IVM tolerant strain, DA1316, was used to minimise transcriptomic changes related to the phenotype of drug exposure. However, unlike equivalent work with benzimidazole drugs, very few of the induced genes were members of xenobiotic metabolising enzyme families. Instead, the transcriptional response was dominated by genes associated with fat mobilization and fatty acid metabolism including catalase, esterase, and fatty acid CoA synthetase genes. This is consistent with the reduction in pharyngeal pumping, and consequential reduction in food intake, upon exposure of DA1316 worms to IVM. Genes with the highest fold change in response to IVM exposure, cyp-37B1, mtl-1 and scl-2, were comparably up-regulated in response to short-term food withdrawal (4 hr) independent of IVM exposure, and GFP reporter constructs confirm their expression in tissues associated with fat storage (intestine and hypodermis). These experiments have serendipitously identified novel genes involved in an early response of C. elegans to reduced food intake and may provide insight into similar processes in higher organisms.",
        "The well-established left hemisphere specialisation for language processing has long been claimed to be based on a low-level auditory specialization for specific acoustic features in speech, particularly regarding 'rapid temporal processing'.A novel analysis/synthesis technique was used to construct a variety of sounds based on simple sentences which could be manipulated in spectro-temporal complexity, and whether they were intelligible or not. All sounds consisted of two noise-excited spectral prominences (based on the lower two formants in the original speech) which could be static or varying in frequency and/or amplitude independently. Dynamically varying both acoustic features based on the same sentence led to intelligible speech but when either or both acoustic features were static, the stimuli were not intelligible. Using the frequency dynamics from one sentence with the amplitude dynamics of another led to unintelligible sounds of comparable spectro-temporal complexity to the intelligible ones. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to compare which brain regions were active when participants listened to the different sounds.Neural activity to spectral and amplitude modulations sufficient to support speech intelligibility (without actually being intelligible) was seen bilaterally, with a right temporal lobe dominance. A left dominant response was seen only to intelligible sounds. It thus appears that the left hemisphere specialisation for speech is based on the linguistic properties of utterances, not on particular acoustic features.",
        "Hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule binding protein Tau is a feature of a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Tau is hyperphosphorylated in the hippocampus of dab1-null mice in a strain-dependent manner; however, it has not been clear if the Tau phosphorylation phenotype is a secondary effect of the morbidity of these mutants. The dab1 gene encodes a docking protein that is required for normal brain lamination and dendritogenesis as part of the Reelin signaling pathway. We show that dab1 gene inactivation after brain development leads to Tau hyperphosphorylation in anatomically normal mice. Genomic regions that regulate the phospho Tau phenotype in dab1 mutants have previously been identified. Using a microarray gene expression comparison between dab1-mutants from the high-phospho Tau expressing and low-phospho Tau expressing strains, we identified Stk25 as a differentially expressed modifier of dab1-mutant phenotypes. Stk25 knockdown reduces Tau phosphorylation in embryonic neurons. Furthermore, Stk25 regulates neuronal polarization and Golgi morphology in an antagonistic manner to Dab1. This work provides insights into the complex regulation of neuronal behavior during brain development and provides insights into the molecular cascades that regulate Tau phosphorylation.",
        "In order to characterise the function of the novel fibrillar type XXVII collagen, a series of mice expressing mutant forms of the collagen were investigated. Mice harboring a glycine to cysteine substitution in the collagenous domain were phenotypically normal when heterozygote and displayed a mild disruption of growth plate architecture in the homozygous state. Mice expressing an 87 amino acid deletion in the collagenous domain of collagen XXVII were phenotypically normal as heterozygotes whereas homozygotes exhibited a severe chondrodysplasia and died perinatally from a lung defect. Animals expressing the 87 amino acid deletion targeted specifically to cartilage were viable but severely dwarfed. The pericellular matrix of proliferative chondrocytes was disrupted and the proliferative cells exhibited a decreased tendency to flatten and form vertical columns. Collagen XXVII plays an important structural role in the pericellular extracellular matrix of the growth plate and is required for the organisation of the proliferative zone.",
        "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is the result of dysregulation of mucosal innate and adaptive immune responses. Factors such as genetic, microbial and environmental are involved in the development of these disorders. Accordingly, animal models that mimic human diseases are tools for the understanding the immunological processes of the IBD as well as to evaluate new therapeutic strategies. Crotoxin (CTX) is the main component of Crotalus durissus terrificus snake venom and has an immunomodulatory effect. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the modulatory effect of CTX in a murine model of colitis induced by 2,4,6- trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). The CTX was administered intraperitoneally 18 hours after the TNBS intrarectal instillation in BALB/c mice. The CTX administration resulted in decreased weight loss, disease activity index (DAI), macroscopic tissue damage, histopathological score and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity analyzed after 4 days of acute TNBS colitis. Furthermore, the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were lower in colon tissue homogenates of TNBS-mice that received the CTX when compared with untreated TNBS mice. The analysis of distinct cell populations obtained from the intestinal lamina propria showed that CTX reduced the number of group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) and Th17 population; CTX decreased IL-17 secretion but did not alter the frequency of CD4+Tbet+ T cells induced by TNBS instillation in mice. In contrast, increased CD4+FoxP3+ cell population as well as secretion of TGF-β, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and lipoxin A4 (LXA4) was observed in TNBS-colitis mice treated with CTX compared with untreated TNBS-colitis mice. In conclusion, the CTX is able to modulate the intestinal acute inflammatory response induced by TNBS, resulting in the improvement of clinical status of the mice. This effect of CTX is complex and involves the suppression of the pro-inflammatory environment elicited by intrarectal instillation of TNBS due to the induction of a local anti-inflammatory profile in mice.",
        "Bottlenose dolphin stock structure in the northeast Atlantic remains poorly understood. However, fine scale photo-id data have shown that populations can comprise multiple overlapping social communities. These social communities form structural elements of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) [corrected] populations, reflecting specific ecological and behavioural adaptations to local habitats. We investigated the social structure of bottlenose dolphins in the waters of northwest Ireland and present evidence for distinct inshore and offshore social communities. Individuals of the inshore community had a coastal distribution restricted to waters within 3 km from shore. These animals exhibited a cohesive, fission-fusion social organisation, with repeated resightings within the research area, within a larger coastal home range. The offshore community comprised one or more distinct groups, found significantly further offshore (>4 km) than the inshore animals. In addition, dorsal fin scarring patterns differed significantly between inshore and offshore communities with individuals of the offshore community having more distinctly marked dorsal fins. Specifically, almost half of the individuals in the offshore community (48%) had characteristic stereotyped damage to the tip of the dorsal fin, rarely recorded in the inshore community (7%). We propose that this characteristic is likely due to interactions with pelagic fisheries. Social segregation and scarring differences found here indicate that the distinct communities are likely to be spatially and behaviourally segregated. Together with recent genetic evidence of distinct offshore and coastal population structures, this provides evidence for bottlenose dolphin inshore/offshore community differentiation in the northeast Atlantic. We recommend that social communities should be considered as fundamental units for the management and conservation of bottlenose dolphins and their habitat specialisations.",
        "Surveillance and effective management of drug resistance is important to sustaining tuberculosis (TB) control efforts. We aimed to determine resistance rates to first line anti tuberculosis drugs and to describe factors associated with the resistance to any of the first line anti tuberculosis drugs in Dar es Salaam Tanzania.Newly diagnosed, TB patients with neither history of tuberculosis treatment nor isoniazid prophylaxis were included into the study. Sputum specimens were cultured on either mycobacteria growth indicator tube 960 (MGIT 960) or Lowenstein Jenstein (LJ) medium supplemented with either glycerol (GLJ) or pyruvate (PLJ). Drug susceptibility for isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin and ethambutol was determined by either Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium or mycobacteria growth indicator tube 960 (MGIT 960).A total of 933 newly diagnosed TB patients, were included into the study. Multi drug resistance (MDR) tuberculosis was detected among 2 (0.2%) patients. Resistance to any of the four tested drugs was detected among 54 (5.8%) patients. Mono-resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin and ethambutol were 21(2.3%), 3 (0.3%), 13 (1.4%), 9 (1.0%) respectively.Primary resistance to first line anti tuberculosis drugs is still low in this setting. Continued vigilance including periodic national surveillance of anti-tuberculosis resistance is recommended.",
        "There is substantial biochemical, pathological, and genetic evidence that α-synuclein (A-syn) is a principal molecule in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD). We previously reported that total A-syn levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), measured with the specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) developed by ourselves, were decreased in patients with PD, and suggested the usefulness of A-syn in CSF and plasma as a biomarker for the diagnosis of PD. After our report, a considerable number of studies have investigated the levels A-syn in CSF and in blood, but have reported inconclusive results. Such discrepancies have often been attributed not only to the use of different antibodies in the ELISAs but also to interference from hemolysis. In this study we measured the levels of A-syn in CSF and plasma by using our own sandwich ELISA with or without heterophilic antibody (HA) inhibitor in 30 patients with PD and 58 age-matched controls. We thereby revealed that HA interfered with ELISA measurements of A-syn and are accordingly considered to be an important confounder in A-syn ELISAs. HA produced falsely exaggerated signals in A-syn ELISAs more prominently in plasma samples than in CSF samples. After elimination of HA interference, it was found that hemolysis did not have a significant effect on the signals obtained using our A-syn ELISA. Furthermore, plasma levels of A-syn were significantly lower in the PD group compared with the control group following elimination of HA interference with an HA inhibitor. Our results demonstrate that HA was a major confounder that should be controlled in A-syn ELISAs, and that plasma A-syn could be a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of PD if adequately quantified following elimination of HA interference.",
        "Fat deposition is highly correlated with the growth, meat quality, reproductive performance and immunity of pigs. Fatty acid synthesis takes place mainly in the adipose tissue of pigs; therefore, in this study, a high-throughput massively parallel sequencing approach was used to generate adipose tissue transcriptomes from two groups of Songliao black pigs that had opposite backfat thickness phenotypes. The total number of paired-end reads produced for each sample was in the range of 39.29-49.36 millions. Approximately 188 genes were differentially expressed in adipose tissue and were enriched for metabolic processes, such as fatty acid biosynthesis, lipid synthesis, metabolism of fatty acids, etinol, caffeine and arachidonic acid and immunity. Additionally, many genetic variations were detected between the two groups through pooled whole-genome resequencing. Integration of transcriptome and whole-genome resequencing data revealed important genomic variations among the differentially expressed genes for fat deposition, for example, the lipogenic genes. Further studies are required to investigate the roles of candidate genes in fat deposition to improve pig breeding programs.",
        "Childhood trauma is associated with premature declines in health in midlife and old age. Pathways that have been implicated, but less studied include social-emotional regulation, biological programming, and habitual patterns of thought and action. In this study we focused on childhood trauma's influence via alterations in social-emotional regulation to everyday life events, a pathway that has been linked to subsequent health effects. Data from a 30-day daily diary of community residents who participated in a study of resilience in Midlife (n = 191, Mage = 54, SD = 7.50, 54% women) was used to examine whether self-reports of childhood trauma were associated with daily well-being, as well as reported and emotional reactivity to daily negative and positive events. Childhood trauma reports were associated with reporting lower overall levels of and greater variability in daily well-being. Childhood trauma was linked to greater reports of daily negative events, but not to positive events. Focusing on emotional reactivity to daily events, residents who reported higher levels of childhood trauma showed stronger decreases in well-being when experiencing negative events and also stronger increases in well-being with positive events. For those reporting childhood trauma, higher levels of mastery were associated with stronger decreases in well-being with negative events and stronger increases in well-being with positive events, suggesting that mastery increases sensitivity to daily negative and positive events. Our results suggest that childhood trauma may lead to poorer health in midlife through disturbances in the patterns of everyday life events and responses to those events. Further, our findings indicate that mastery may have a different meaning for those who experienced childhood trauma. We discuss social-emotional regulation as one pathway linking childhood trauma to health, and psychosocial resources to consider when building resilience-promoting interventions for mitigating the detrimental health effects of childhood trauma.",
        "The complexes formed by BCL10, MALT1 and specific members of the family of CARMA proteins (CBM complex), have recently focused much attention because they represent a central hub regulating activation of the transcription factor NF-κB following various cellular stimulations. In this manuscript, we report the functional characterization of a Danio rerio 241 amino acids polypeptide ortholog of the Caspase recruiting domain (CARD)-containing protein BCL10. Biochemical studies show that zebrafish Bcl10 (zBcl10) dimerizes and binds to components of the CBM complex. Fluorescence microscopy observations demonstrate that zBcl10 forms cytoplasmic filaments similar to that formed by human BCL10 (hBCL10). Functionally, in human cells zBcl10 is more effective in activating NF-κB compared to hBCL10, possibly due to the lack of carboxy-terminal inhibitory serine residues present in the human protein. Also, depletion experiments carried out through expression of short hairpin RNAs targeting hBCL10 indicate that zBcl10 can functionally replace the human protein. Finally, we show that the zebrafish cell line PAC2 is suitable to carry out reporter assays for monitoring the activation state of NF- kB transcription factor. In conclusion, this work shows that zebrafish may excellently serve as a model organism to study complex and intricate signal transduction pathways, such as those that control NF-κB activation.",
        "Applying distance-to-frontier analysis, we have used 2.9 million patents and population data to assess whether the relative capacity of world countries and major regions to create new knowledge and technology has become globally more equal or less equal between 1990 and 2010. We show with the Gini coefficient that the global distribution of inventors has become more equal between major countries and regions. However, this trend has been largely due to the improved performance of only two major countries, China and India. The worst performing regions, totalling a population of almost 2 billion, are actually falling behind. Our results suggest that substantial parts of the global population have fallen further behind countries at the global frontier in their ability to create new knowledge and inventions, and that the catch-up among the least developed and middle-income countries is highly uneven, prompting questions about the nature and future of the global knowledge economy.",
        "The Central Asian flora plays a significant role in Eurasia and the Northern Hemisphere. Calophaca, a member of this flora, includes eight currently recognized species, and is centered in Central Asia, with some taxa extending into adjacent areas. A phylogenetic analysis of the genus utilizing nuclear ribosomal ITS and plastid trnS-trnG and rbcL sequences was carried out in order to confirm its taxonomic status and reconstruct its evolutionary history.We employed BEAST Bayesian inference for dating, and S-DIVA and BBM for ancestral area reconstruction, to study its spatiotemporal evolution. Our results show that Calophacais monophyletic and nested within Caragana. The divergence time of Calophaca is estimated at ca. 8.0 Ma, most likely driven by global cooling and aridification, influenced by rapid uplift of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau margins.According to ancestral area reconstructions, the genus most likely originated in the Pamir Mountains, a global biodiversity hotspot and hypothesized Tertiary refugium of many Central Asian plant lineages. Dispersals from this location are inferred to the western Tianshan Mountains, then northward to the Tarbagatai Range, eastward to East Asia, and westward to the Caucasus, Russia, and Europe. The spatiotemporal evolution of Calophaca provides a case contributing to an understanding of the flora and biodiversity of the Central Asian mountains and adjacent regions.",
        "This study aims to investigate the potential nanotoxic effects of TiO2 nanoparticles (TNPs) to dams and pups during lactation period. TiO2 nanoparticles are accumulated in mammary glands of lactating mice after i.v. administration. This accumulation of TiO2 NP likely causes a ROS-induced disruption of tight junction of the blood-milk barrier as indicated by the loss of tight junction proteins and the shedding of alveolar epithelial cells. Compared to larger TNPs (50 nm), smaller ones (8 nm) exhibit a higher accumulation in mammary glands and are more potent in causing perturbations to blood-milk barrier. An alarming finding is that the smaller TNPs (8 nm) are transferred from dams to pups through breastfeeding, likely through the disrupted blood-milk barrier. However, during the lactation period, the nutrient quality of milk from dams and the early developmental landmarks of the pups are not affected by above perturbations.",
        "Wildlife as a source of microbial contamination is a food safety concern. Deer feces (scat) have been determined as a point source for Escherichia coli O157:H7 contamination of fresh produce. The ecological role of the scooped scarab (Onthophagus hecate (Panzer)), a generalist dung beetle species common in Maine blueberry fields, was explored as a biological control agent and alternatively as a pathogen vector between deer scat and food. A large-scale field survey of wildlife scat indicated that pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 was present, albeit at a low prevalence (1.9% of samples, n = 318), in the Maine lowbush blueberry agroecosystem. A manipulative field experiment verified that, should contact occur between deer scat and blueberry plants and fruit during the summer, contamination with E. coli O157:H7 can occur and persist for more than 72 h. For both the positive control and an experimental scat inoculation treatment, the levels of the bacterial population decreased over time, but at different rates (treatment x time interaction: F (1.9,18.8) = 358.486, P < 0.0001). The positive control inoculation, which resulted in a higher initial E. coli level on fruit, decayed at a faster rate than inoculation of fruit via scat in the experimental treatment. We conducted 2 laboratory studies to elucidate aspects of dung beetle feeding ecology as it relates to suppression of E. coli O157:H7 from deer scat to lowbush blueberry fruit. In both experiments, dung beetles buried the same amount of scat whether or not the scat was inoculated with the pathogen (F(1,6) = 0.001; P = 0.999 and (F (2,17) = 4.10, P = 0.147). Beetles feeding on E. coli inoculated deer scat were not found to vector the pathogen to fruit. In two studies, beetles lowered the amount of pathogenic E. coli persisting in soils compared to soils without beetles (F (2,9) = 7.757; P = 0.05 and F (2,17) = 8.0621, P = 0.004). Our study suggests that the dung beetle species, Onthophagus hecate, has the potential to contribute to the suppression of E. coli O157:H7 in agricultural landscapes.",
        "Nowadays molecular species delimitation methods promote the identification of species boundaries within complex taxonomic groups by adopting innovative species concepts and theories (e.g. branching patterns, coalescence). As some of them can efficiently deal with large single-locus datasets, they could speed up the process of species discovery compared to more time consuming molecular methods, and benefit from the existence of large public datasets; these methods can also particularly favour scientific research and actions dealing with threatened or economically important taxa. In this study we aim to investigate and clarify the status of economically important moths species belonging to the genus Spodoptera (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae), a complex group in which previous phylogenetic analyses and integrative approaches already suggested the possible occurrence of cryptic species and taxonomic ambiguities. In this work, the effectiveness of innovative (and faster) species delimitation approaches to infer putative species boundaries has been successfully tested in Spodoptera, by processing the most comprehensive dataset (in terms of number of species and specimens) ever achieved; results are congruent and reliable, irrespective of the set of parameters and phylogenetic models applied. Our analyses confirm the existence of three potential new species clusters (for S. exigua (Hübner, 1808), S. frugiperda (J.E. Smith, 1797) and S. mauritia (Boisduval, 1833)) and support the synonymy of S. marima (Schaus, 1904) with S. ornithogalli (Guenée, 1852). They also highlight the ambiguity of the status of S. cosmiodes (Walker, 1858) and S. descoinsi Lalanne-Cassou & Silvain, 1994. This case study highlights the interest of molecular species delimitation methods as valuable tools for species discovery and to emphasize taxonomic ambiguities.",
        "The AP2/ERF family includes a large number of developmentally and physiologically important transcription factors sharing an AP2 DNA-binding domain. Among them DREB1/CBF and DREB2 factors are known as master regulators respectively of cold and heat/osmotic stress responses.The manual annotation of AP2/ERF family from Eucalyptus grandis, Malus, Populus and Vitis genomes allowed a complete phylogenetic study for comparing the structure of this family in woody species and the model Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression profiles of the whole groups of EgrDREB1 and EgrDREB2 were investigated through RNAseq database survey and RT-qPCR analyses.The structure and the size of the AP2/ERF family show a global conservation for the plant species under comparison. In addition to an expansion of the ERF subfamily, the tree genomes mainly differ with respect to the group representation within the subfamilies. With regard to the E. grandis DREB subfamily, an obvious feature is the presence of 17 DREB1/CBF genes, the maximum reported to date for dicotyledons. In contrast, only six DREB2 have been identified, which is similar to the other plants species under study, except for Malus. All the DREB1/CBF and DREB2 genes from E. grandis are expressed in at least one condition and all are heat-responsive. Regulation by cold and drought depends on the genes but is not specific of one group; DREB1/CBF group is more cold-inducible than DREB2 which is mainly drought responsive.These features suggest that the dramatic expansion of the DREB1/CBF group might be related to the adaptation of this evergreen tree to climate changes when it expanded in Australia.",
        "Mammary tumors and malignant breast cancer cell lines over-express the coagulation factor, tissue factor (TF). High expression of TF is associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), the endogenous inhibitor of TF, is constitutively expressed on the endothelium. We hypothesized that TF-expressing tumor cells can bind to immobilized recombinant TFPI, leading to arrest of the tumor cells under shear in vitro. We evaluated the adhesion of breast cancer cells to immobilized TFPI under static and shear conditions (0.35 - 1.3 dyn/cm2). We found that high-TF-expressing breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 (with a TF density of 460,000/cell), but not low TF-expressing MCF-7 (with a TF density of 1,400/cell), adhered to recombinant TFPI, under static and shear conditions. Adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells to TFPI required activated factor VII (FVIIa), but not FX, and was inhibited by a factor VIIa-blocking anti-TF antibody. Under shear, adhesion to TFPI was dependent on the TFPI-coating concentration, FVIIa concentration and shear stress, with no observed adhesion at shear stresses greater than 1.0 dyn/cm2. This is the first study showing that TF-expressing tumor cells can be captured by immobilized TFPI, a ligand constitutively expressed on the endothelium, under low shear in vitro. Based on our results, we hypothesize that TFPI could be a novel ligand mediating the arrest of TF-expressing tumor cells in high TFPI-expressing vessels under conditions of low shear during metastasis.",
        "The objective of this study was to identify new viral biomarkers associated with acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) by complete genomic sequencing of HBV. Hepatitis B virus mutations associated with ACLF were screened by Illumina high-throughput sequencing in twelve ACLF cases and twelve age-matched mild chronic hepatitis B patients, which were validated in 438 chronic hepatitis B patients (80 asymptomatic carriers, 152 mild chronic hepatitis B patients, 102 severe chronic hepatitis B patients and 104 ACLF patients) by direct sequencing. The results of Illumina sequencing showed that the mutations at 7 sites (T216C, G285A, A1846T, G1896A, C1913A/G, A2159G, and A2189C) of 12 ACLF patients were significantly higher than those of 12 controls. In the validation cohorts, a significantly higher ratio of genotype B to C was found in patients with ACLF than in patients with non-ACLF. Multivariate analysis showed that T216C, G1896A, C1913A/G and A2159G/C were independent risk factors for ACLF. C216 in any combination, A/G1913 in any combination, and G/C2159 in any combination had high specificity for ACLF. In summary, T216C and A2159G/C mutations were novel factors independently associated with ACLF. Combined mutations in hepatitis B cases could play important roles in ACLF development.",
        "Health research is one mechanism to improve population-level health and should generally match the health needs of populations. However, there have been limited data to assess the trends in national-level cardiovascular research output, even as cardiovascular disease [CVD] has become the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.We performed a time trends analysis of cardiovascular research publications (1999-2008) downloaded from Web of Knowledge using a iteratively-tested cardiovascular bibliometric filter with >90% precision and recall. We evaluated cardiovascular research publications, five-year running actual citation indices [ACIs], and degree of international collaboration measured through the ratio of the fractional count of addresses from one country against all addresses for each publication.Global cardiovascular publication volume increased from 40 661 publications in 1999 to 55 284 publications in 2008, which represents a 36% increase. The proportion of cardiovascular publications from high-income, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD] countries declined from 93% to 84% of the total share over the study period. High-income, OECD countries generally had higher fractional counts, which suggest less international collaboration, than lower income countries from 1999-2008. There was an inverse relationship between cardiovascular publications and age-standardized CVD morbidity and mortality rates, but a direct, curvilinear relationship between cardiovascular publications and Human Development Index from 1999-2008.Cardiovascular health research output has increased substantially in the past decade, with a greater share of citations being published from low- and middle-income countries. However, low- and middle-income countries with the higher burdens of cardiovascular disease continue to have lower research output than high-income countries, and thus require targeted research investments to improve cardiovascular health.",
        "Previous studies of HIV acquisition in pregnancy have been in specific population groups, such as sero-discordant couples which have shown an increased risk of HIV acquisition during pregnancy and studies of sexually active women where the results have been ambiguous. However these studies are unable to tell us what the overall impact of pregnancy is on HIV acquisition in the general population.Data from six community-based HIV cohorts were pooled to give 2,628 sero-conversions and a total of 178,000 person years of observation. Multiple imputation was used to allow for the uncertainty of exact sero-conversion date in surveillance intervals greater than the length of a pregnancy. Results were combined using Rubin's rules to give appropriate error bounds. The analysis was stratified into two periods: pre- and post- widespread availability of prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services. This allows us to assess whether there is reporting bias relating to a person's knowledge of their own HIV status which would become more widespread in the latter time period.Results suggest that women while pregnant have a lower risk of acquiring HIV infection over all periods (HRR 0.79, 95%CI 0.70-0.89) than women who were not pregnant. There is no evidence for a difference in the rate of HIV acquisition between postpartum and non-pregnant women (HRR 0.92 95%CI 0.84-1.03).Although there may be immunological reasons for increased risk of HIV acquisition during pregnancy, at a population level this study indicates a lower risk of HIV acquisition for pregnant women. Pregnant women may be more likely to be concordant with their current sexual partner than non-pregnant women, i.e. either already HIV positive prior to the pregnancy or if negative at the time of becoming pregnant more likely to have a negative partner.",
        "The Sundarbans tiger inhabits a unique mangrove habitat and are morphologically distinct from the recognized tiger subspecies in terms of skull morphometrics and body size. Thus, there is an urgent need to assess their ecological and genetic distinctiveness and determine if Sundarbans tigers should be defined and managed as separate conservation unit. We utilized nine microsatellites and 3 kb from four mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes to estimate genetic variability, population structure, demographic parameters and visualize historic and contemporary connectivity among tiger populations from Sundarbans and mainland India. We also evaluated the traits that determine exchangeability or adaptive differences among tiger populations. Data from both markers suggest that Sundarbans tiger is not a separate tiger subspecies and should be regarded as Bengal tiger (P. t. tigris) subspecies. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses of the mtDNA data revealed reciprocal monophyly. Genetic differentiation was found stronger for mtDNA than nuclear DNA. Microsatellite markers indicated low genetic variation in Sundarbans tigers (He= 0.58) as compared to other mainland populations, such as northern and Peninsular (Hebetween 0.67- 0.70). Molecular data supports migration between mainland and Sundarbans populations until very recent times. We attribute this reduction in gene flow to accelerated fragmentation and habitat alteration in the landscape over the past few centuries. Demographic analyses suggest that Sundarbans tigers have diverged recently from peninsular tiger population within last 2000 years. Sundarbans tigers are the most divergent group of Bengal tigers, and ecologically non-exchangeable with other tiger populations, and thus should be managed as a separate \"evolutionarily significant unit\" (ESU) following the adaptive evolutionary conservation (AEC) concept.",
        "Global plant trait studies have revealed fundamental trade-offs in plant resource economics. We evaluated such trait trade-offs during secondary succession in two species-rich tropical ecosystems that contrast in precipitation: dry deciduous and wet evergreen forests of Mexico. Species turnover with succession in dry forest largely relates to increasing water availability and in wet forest to decreasing light availability. We hypothesized that while functional trait trade-offs are similar in the two forest systems, the successful plant strategies in these communities will be different, as contrasting filters affect species turnover. Research was carried out in 15 dry secondary forest sites (5-63 years after abandonment) and in 17 wet secondary forest sites (<1-25 years after abandonment). We used 11 functional traits measured on 132 species to make species-trait PCA biplots for dry and wet forest and compare trait trade-offs. We evaluated whether multivariate plant strategies changed during succession, by calculating a 'Community-Weighted Mean' plant strategy, based on species scores on the first two PCA-axes. Trait spectra reflected two main trade-off axes that were similar for dry and wet forest species: acquisitive versus conservative species, and drought avoiding species versus evergreen species with large animal-dispersed seeds. These trait associations were consistent when accounting for evolutionary history. Successional changes in the most successful plant strategies reflected different functional trait spectra depending on the forest type. In dry forest the community changed from having drought avoiding strategies early in succession to increased abundance of evergreen strategies with larger seeds late in succession. In wet forest the community changed from species having mainly acquisitive strategies to those with more conservative strategies during succession. These strategy changes were explained by increasing water availability during dry forest succession and increasing light scarcity during wet forest succession. Although similar trait spectra were observed among dry and wet secondary forest species, the consequences for succession were different resulting from contrasting environmental filters.",
        "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain cancer in adults and there are few effective treatments. GBMs contain cells with molecular and cellular characteristics of neural stem cells that drive tumour growth. Here we compare responses of human glioblastoma-derived neural stem (GNS) cells and genetically normal neural stem (NS) cells to a panel of 160 small molecule kinase inhibitors. We used live-cell imaging and high content image analysis tools and identified JNJ-10198409 (J101) as an agent that induces mitotic arrest at prometaphase in GNS cells but not NS cells. Antibody microarrays and kinase profiling suggested that J101 responses are triggered by suppression of the active phosphorylated form of polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) (phospho T210), with resultant spindle defects and arrest at prometaphase. We found that potent and specific Plk1 inhibitors already in clinical development (BI 2536, BI 6727 and GSK 461364) phenocopied J101 and were selective against GNS cells. Using a porcine brain endothelial cell blood-brain barrier model we also observed that these compounds exhibited greater blood-brain barrier permeability in vitro than J101. Our analysis of mouse mutant NS cells (INK4a/ARF(-/-), or p53(-/-)), as well as the acute genetic deletion of p53 from a conditional p53 floxed NS cell line, suggests that the sensitivity of GNS cells to BI 2536 or J101 may be explained by the lack of a p53-mediated compensatory pathway. Together these data indicate that GBM stem cells are acutely susceptible to proliferative disruption by Plk1 inhibitors and that such agents may have immediate therapeutic value.",
        "Detection of meningococcal carriers is key to understanding the epidemiology of Neisseria meningitidis, yet no gold standard has been established. Here, we directly compare two methods for collecting pharyngeal swabs to identify meningococcal carriers.We conducted cross-sectional surveys of schoolchildren at multiple sites in Africa to compare swabbing the posterior pharynx behind the uvula (U) to swabbing the posterior pharynx behind the uvula plus one tonsil (T). Swabs were cultured immediately and analyzed using molecular methods.One thousand and six paired swab samples collected from schoolchildren in four countries were analyzed. Prevalence of meningococcal carriage was 6.9% (95% CI: 5.4-8.6%) based on the results from both swabs, but the observed prevalence was lower based on one swab type alone. Prevalence based on the T swab or the U swab alone was similar (5.2% (95% CI: 3.8-6.7%) versus 4.9% (95% CI: 3.6-6.4%) respectively (p=0.6)). The concordance between the two methods was 96.3% and the kappa was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.50-0.73), indicating good agreement.These two commonly used methods for collecting pharyngeal swabs provide consistent estimates of the prevalence of carriage, but both methods misclassified carriers to some degree, leading to underestimates of the prevalence.",
        "When performing a skill such as throwing a dart, many different combinations of joint motions suffice to hit the target. The motor system adapts rapidly to reduce bias in the desired outcome (i.e., the first-order moment of the error); however, the essence of skill is to produce movements with less variability (i.e., to reduce the second-order moment). It is easy to see how feedback about success or failure could sculpt performance to achieve this aim. However, it is unclear whether the dimensions responsible for success or failure need to be known explicitly by the subjects, or whether learning can proceed without explicit awareness of the movement parameters that need to change. Here, we designed a redundant, two-dimensional reaching task in which we could selectively manipulate task success and the variability of action outcomes, whilst also manipulating awareness of the dimension along which performance could be improved. Variability was manipulated either by amplifying natural errors, leaving the correlation between the executed movement and the visual feedback intact, or by adding extrinsic noise, decorrelating movement and feedback. We found that explicit, binary, feedback about success or failure was only sufficient for learning when participants were aware of the dimension along which motor behavior had to change. Without such awareness, learning was only present when extrinsic noise was added to the feedback, but not when task success or variability was manipulated in isolation; learning was also much slower. Our results highlight the importance of conscious awareness of the relevant dimension during motor learning, and suggest that higher-order moments of outcome signals are likely to play a significant role in skill learning in complex tasks.",
        "Due to the scale up of antiretroviral therapy, increasing numbers of HIV-infected children are living into adolescence. As these children grow and surpass the immediate threat of death, the issue of informing them of their HIV status arises. This study aimed to understand how perinatally-infected adolescents learn about their HIV-status as well as to examine their preferences for the disclosure process.In-depth interviews were conducted with 31 (14 male, 17 female) perinatally-infected adolescents aged 16-20 at an HIV clinic in Harare, Zimbabwe, and focused on adolescents' experiences of disclosure. In addition, 15 (1 male, 14 female) healthcare workers participated in two focus groups that were centred on healthcare workers' practices surrounding disclosure in the clinic. Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants. A coding frame was developed and major themes were extracted using grounded theory methods.Healthcare workers encouraged caregivers to initiate disclosure in the home environment. However, many adolescents preferred disclosure to take place in the presence of healthcare workers at the clinic because it gave them access to accurate information as well as an environment that made test results seem more credible. Adolescents learned more specific information about living with an HIV-positive status and the meaning of that status from shared experiences among peers at the clinic.HIV-status disclosure to adolescents is distinct from disclosure to younger children and requires tailored, age-appropriate guidelines. Disclosure to this age group in a healthcare setting may help overcome some of the barriers associated with caregivers disclosing in the home environment and make the HIV status seem more credible to an adolescent. The study also highlights the value of peer support among adolescents, which could help reduce the burden of psychosocial care on caregivers and healthcare workers.",
        "Pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) are skeletal disorders resulting from mutations in COMP, matrilin-3 or collagen IX and are characterised by short-limbed dwarfism and premature osteoarthritis. Interestingly, recent reports suggest patients can also manifest with muscle weakness. Here we present a detailed analysis of two mouse models of the PSACH/MED disease spectrum; ΔD469 T3-COMP (PSACH) and V194D matrilin-3 (MED). In grip test experiments T3-COMP mice were weaker than wild-type littermates, whereas V194D mice behaved as controls, confirming that short-limbed dwarfism alone does not contribute to PSACH/MED-related muscle weakness. Muscles from T3-COMP mice showed an increase in centronuclear fibers at the myotendinous junction. T3-COMP tendons became more lax in cyclic testing and showed thicker collagen fibers when compared with wild-type tissue; matrilin-3 mutant tissues were indistinguishable from controls. This comprehensive study of the myopathy associated with PSACH/MED mutations enables a better understanding of the disease progression, confirms that it is genotype specific and that the limb weakness originates from muscle and tendon pathology rather than short-limbed dwarfism itself. Since some patients are primarily diagnosed with neuromuscular symptoms, this study will facilitate better awareness of the differential diagnoses that might be associated with the PSACH/MED spectrum and subsequent care of PSACH/MED patients.",
        "To investigate if the lack of gestational age correction may explain some of the school failure seen in ex-preterm infants.A cohort study based on the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). The primary outcome was a low Key Stage 1 score (KS1) score at age 7 or having special educational needs (SEN). Exposure groups were defined as preterm (<37 weeks gestation, n = 722) or term (37-42 weeks, n = 11,268). Conditional regression models were derived, matching preterm to term infants on date of birth (DOB), expected date of delivery (EDD) or expected date of delivery and year of school entry. Multiple imputation was used to account for missing covariate data.When matching for DOB, infants born preterm had an increased odds of a low KS1 score (OR 1.73 (1.45-2.06)) and this association persisted after adjusting for potential confounders (OR 1.57 (1.25-1.97)). The association persisted in the analysis matching for EDD (fully adjusted OR 1.53 (1.21-1.94)) but attenuated substantially after additionally restricting to those infants who entered school at the same time as the control infants (fully adjusted OR 1.25 (0.98-1.60)). A compatible reduction in the population attributable risk fraction was seen from 4.60% to 2.12%, and year of school entry appeared to modify the association between gestational age and the risk of a poor KS1 score (p = 0.029).This study provides evidence that the school year placement and assessment of ex-preterm infants based on their actual birthday (rather than their EDD) may increase their risk of learning difficulties with corresponding school failure.",
        "An IFN-γ response to M. tuberculosis-specific antigens is an effective biomarker for M. tuberculosis infection but it cannot discriminate between latent TB infection and active TB disease. Combining a number of cytokine/chemokine responses to M. tuberculosis antigens may enable differentiation of latent TB from active disease.Asymptomatic recently-exposed individuals (spouses of TB patients) were recruited and tuberculin skin tested, bled and followed-up for two years. Culture supernatants, from a six-day culture of diluted whole blood samples stimulated with M. tuberculosis-derived PPD or ESAT-6, were measured for IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, TNF-α and CXCL10 using cytokine ELISAs. In addition, 15 patients with sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB were recruited and tested.Spouses with positive IFN-γ responses to M. tuberculosis ESAT-6 (>62.5 pg/mL) and TB patients showed high production of IL-17, CXCL10 and TNF-α. Higher production of IL-10 and IL-17 in response to ESAT-6 was observed in the spouses compared with TB patients while the ratios of IFN-γ/IL-10 and IFN-γ/IL-17 in response to M. tuberculosis-derived PPD were significantly higher in TB patients compared with the spouses. Tuberculin skin test results did not correlate with cytokine responses.CXCL10 and TNF-α may be used as adjunct markers alongside an IFN-γ release assay to diagnose M. tuberculosis infection, and IL-17 and IL-10 production may differentiate individuals with LTBI from active TB.",
        "In alpine Australia, Orthoptera are abundant, dominant herbivores, important prey species, and hosts for parasites and parasitoids. Despite the central role of orthopterans in alpine ecosystems, the impact of parasites on orthopteran populations is under-explored. In this study we describe the relationship between parasite prevalence and host sex, body size and year of collection. We accessed an existing, preserved collection of 640 Kosciuscola tristis collected from across its range between 2007 and 2011. Upon dissection we collected juvenile parasites and used molecular tools to identify them to three families (Nematoda; Mermithidae, and Arthropoda: Diptera: Tachinidae and Sarcophagidae). The prevalence of nematodes ranged from 3.5% to 25.0% and dipterans from 2.4% to 20.0%. Contrary to predictions, we found no associations between parasite prevalence and grasshopper sex or size. Although there was an association between prevalence of both nematodes and dipterans with year of collection, this is likely driven by a small sample size in the first year. Our results provide a foundation for future studies into parasite prevalence within the alpine environment and the abiotic factors that might influence these associations.",
        "Heterozygous glucokinase (GCK) mutations cause a subtype of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (GCK-MODY). Over 600 GCK mutations have been reported of which ∼65% are missense. In many cases co-segregation has not been established and despite the importance of functional studies in ascribing pathogenicity for missense variants these have only been performed for <10% of mutations. The aim of this study was to determine the minimum prevalence of GCK-MODY amongst diabetic subjects in Slovakia by sequencing GCK in 100 Slovakian probands with a phenotype consistent with GCK-MODY and to explore the pathogenicity of identified variants through family and functional studies. Twenty-two mutations were identified in 36 families (17 missense) of which 7 (I110N, V200A, N204D, G258R, F419S, c.580-2A>C, c.1113-1114delGC) were novel. Parental DNA was available for 22 probands (covering 14/22 mutations) and co-segregation established in all cases. Bioinformatic analysis predicted all missense mutations to be damaging. Nine (I110N, V200A, N204D, G223S, G258R, F419S, V244G, L315H, I436N) mutations were functionally evaluated. Basic kinetic analysis explained pathogenicity for 7 mutants which showed reduced glucokinase activity with relative activity indices (RAI) between 0.6 to <0.001 compared to wild-type GCK (1.0). For the remaining 2 mutants additional molecular mechanisms were investigated. Differences in glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP) -mediated-inhibition of GCK were observed for both L315H & I436N when compared to wild type (IC(50) 14.6±0.1 mM & 20.3±1.6 mM vs.13.3±0.1 mM respectively [p<0.03]). Protein instability as assessed by thermal lability studies demonstrated that both L315H and I436N show marked thermal instability compared to wild-type GCK (RAI at 55°C 8.8±0.8% & 3.1±0.4% vs. 42.5±3.9% respectively [p<0.001]). The minimum prevalence of GCK-MODY amongst Slovakian patients with diabetes was 0.03%. In conclusion, we have identified 22 GCK mutations in 36 Slovakian probands and demonstrate that combining family, bioinformatic and functional studies can aid the interpretation of variants identified by molecular diagnostic screening.",
        "Although men and women have similar risk factors for cardiovascular disease, many social behaviors in developing countries differ by sex. Rural-to-urban migrants have different cardiovascular risk profiles than rural or urban dwellers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sex differences with specific cardiovascular risk factors in rural-to-urban migrants.We used the rural-to-urban migrant group of the PERU MIGRANT cross-sectional study to investigate the sex differences in specific cardiovascular risk factors: obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, as well as exposures of socioeconomic status, acculturation surrogates and behavioral characteristics. Logistic regression analysis was used to characterize strength of association between sex and our outcomes adjusting for potential confounders. The sample of migrants was 589 (mean age 46.5 years) and 52.4% were female. In the adjusted models, women were more likely to be obese (OR=5.97; 95%CI: 3.21-11) and have metabolic syndrome (OR=2.22; 95%CI: 1.39-3.55) than men, explaining the greatest variability for obesity and metabolic syndrome but not for hypertension.Our results suggest that interventions for CVD in Peru should be sex-specific and address the unique health needs of migrant populations living in urban shantytowns since the risk factors for obesity and metabolic syndrome differ between males and females.",
        "Among birch pollen allergic patients up to 70% develop allergic reactions to Bet v 1-homologue food allergens such as Api g 1 (celery) or Dau c 1 (carrot), termed as birch pollen-related food allergy. In most cases, specific immunotherapy with birch pollen extracts does not reduce allergic symptoms to the homologue food allergens. We therefore genetically engineered a multi-allergen chimer and tested if mucosal treatment with this construct could represent a novel approach for prevention of birch pollen-related food allergy.BALB/c mice were poly-sensitized with a mixture of Bet v 1, Api g 1 and Dau c 1 followed by a sublingual challenge with carrot, celery and birch pollen extracts. For prevention of allergy sensitization an allergen chimer composed of immunodominant T cell epitopes of Api g 1 and Dau c 1 linked to the whole Bet v 1 allergen, was intranasally applied prior to sensitization.Intranasal pretreatment with the allergen chimer led to significantly decreased antigen-specific IgE-dependent β-hexosaminidase release, but enhanced allergen-specific IgG2a and IgA antibodies. Accordingly, IL-4 levels in spleen cell cultures and IL-5 levels in restimulated spleen and cervical lymph node cell cultures were markedly reduced, while IFN-γ levels were increased. Immunomodulation was associated with increased IL-10, TGF-β and Foxp3 mRNA levels in NALT and Foxp3 in oral mucosal tissues. Treatment with anti-TGF-β, anti-IL10R or anti-CD25 antibodies abrogated the suppression of allergic responses induced by the chimer.Our results indicate that mucosal application of the allergen chimer led to decreased Th2 immune responses against Bet v 1 and its homologue food allergens Api g 1 and Dau c 1 by regulatory and Th1-biased immune responses. These data suggest that mucosal treatment with a multi-allergen vaccine could be a promising treatment strategy to prevent birch pollen-related food allergy.",
        "The provision of high doses of thiamine may prevent thiamine deficiency in the post-partum period of displaced persons.The study aimed to evaluate a supplementation regimen of thiamine mononitrate (100 mg daily) at the antenatal clinics in Maela refugee camp. Women were enrolled during antenatal care and followed after delivery. Samples were collected at 12 weeks post partum. Thiamine diphosphate (TDP) in whole blood and thiamine in breast-milk of 636 lactating women were measured. Thiamine in breast-milk consisted of thiamine monophosphate (TMP) in addition to thiamine, with a mean TMP to total thiamine ratio of 63%. Mean whole blood TDP (130 nmol/L) and total thiamine in breast-milk (755 nmol/L) were within the upper range reported for well-nourished women. The prevalence of women with low whole blood TDP (<65 nmol/L) was 5% and with deficient breast-milk total thiamine (<300 nmol/L) was 4%. Whole blood TDP predicted both breast-milk thiamine and TMP (R(2) = 0.36 and 0.10, p<0.001). A ratio of TMP to total thiamine ≥63% was associated with a 7.5 and 4-fold higher risk of low whole blood TDP and deficient total breast-milk thiamine, respectively. Routine provision of daily 100 mg of thiamine mononitrate post-partum compared to the previous weekly 10 mg of thiamine hydrochloride resulted in significantly higher total thiamine in breast-milk.Thiamine supplementation for lactating women in Maela refugee camp is effective and should be continued. TMP and its ratio to total thiamine in breast-milk, reported for the first time in this study, provided useful information on thiamine status and should be included in future studies of breast-milk thiamine.",
        "The innate recognition of fungi by leukocytes is mediated by pattern recognition receptors (PRR), such as Dectin-1, and is thought to occur at the cell surface triggering intracellular signalling cascades which lead to the induction of protective host responses. In the lung, this recognition is aided by surfactant which also serves to maintain the balance between inflammation and pulmonary function, although the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we have explored pulmonary innate recognition of a variety of fungal particles, including zymosan, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus, and demonstrate that opsonisation with surfactant components can limit inflammation by reducing host-cell fungal interactions. However, we found that this opsonisation does not contribute directly to innate fungal recognition and that this process is mediated through non-opsonic PRRs, including Dectin-1. Moreover, we found that pulmonary inflammatory responses to resting Aspergillus conidia were initiated by these PRRs in acidified phagolysosomes, following the uptake of fungal particles by leukocytes. Our data therefore provides crucial new insights into the mechanisms by which surfactant can maintain pulmonary function in the face of microbial challenge, and defines the phagolysosome as a novel intracellular compartment involved in the innate sensing of extracellular pathogens in the lung.",
        "Plasmodium vivax infections seldom kill directly but do cause indirect mortality by reducing birth weight and causing abortion. Cytoadherence and sequestration in the microvasculature are central to the pathogenesis of severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria, but the contribution of cytoadherence to pathology in other human malarias is less clear.The adherence properties of P. vivax infected red blood cells (PvIRBC) were evaluated under static and flow conditions.P. vivax isolates from 33 patients were studied. None adhered to immobilized CD36, ICAM-1, or thrombospondin, putative ligands for P. falciparum vascular cytoadherence, or umbilical vein endothelial cells, but all adhered to immobilized chondroitin sulphate A (CSA) and hyaluronic acid (HA), the receptors for adhesion of P. falciparum in the placenta. PvIRBC also adhered to fresh placental cells (N = 5). Pre-incubation with chondroitinase prevented PvIRBC adherence to CSA, and reduced binding to HA, whereas preincubation with hyaluronidase prevented adherence to HA, but did not reduce binding to CSA significantly. Pre-incubation of PvIRBC with soluble CSA and HA reduced binding to the immobilized receptors and prevented placental binding. PvIRBC adhesion was prevented by pre-incubation with trypsin, inhibited by heparin, and reduced by EGTA. Under laminar flow conditions the mean (SD) shear stress reducing maximum attachment by 50% was 0.06 (0.02) Pa but, having adhered, the PvIRBC could then resist detachment by stresses up to 5 Pa. At 37 °C adherence began approximately 16 hours after red cell invasion with maximal adherence at 30 hours. At 39 °C adherence began earlier and peaked at 24 hours.Adherence of P. vivax-infected erythrocytes to glycosaminoglycans may contribute to the pathogenesis of vivax malaria and lead to intrauterine growth retardation.",
        "We investigated whether previously reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of EPHA2 in European studies are associated with cataract in India.We carried out a population-based genetic association study. We enumerated randomly sampled villages in two areas of north and south India to identify people aged 40 and over. Participants attended a clinical examination including lens photography and provided a blood sample for genotyping. Lens images were graded by the Lens Opacification Classification System (LOCS III). Cataract was defined as a LOCS III grade of nuclear ≥4, cortical ≥3, posterior sub-capsular (PSC) ≥2, or dense opacities or aphakia/pseudophakia in either eye. We genotyped SNPs rs3754334, rs7543472 and rs11260867 on genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using TaqMan assays in an ABI 7900 real-time PCR. We used logistic regression with robust standard errors to examine the association between cataract and the EPHA2 SNPs, adjusting for age, sex and location.7418 participants had data on at least one of the SNPs investigated. Genotype frequencies of controls were in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (p>0.05). There was no association of rs3754334 with cataract or type of cataract. Minor allele homozygous genotypes of rs7543472 and rs11260867 compared to the major homozygote genotype were associated with cortical cataract, Odds ratio (OR) = 1.8, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) (1.1, 3.1) p = 0.03 and 2.9 (1.2, 7.1) p = 0.01 respectively, and with PSC cataract, OR = 1.5 (1.1, 2.2) p = 0.02 and 1.8 (0.9, 3.6) p = 0.07 respectively. There was no consistent association of SNPs with nuclear cataract or a combined variable of any type of cataract including operated cataract.Our results in the Indian population agree with previous studies of the association of EPHA2 variants with cortical cataracts. We report new findings for the association with PSC which is particularly prevalent in Indians.",
        "Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) accounts for two million deaths worldwide annually. In those hospitalised with SAM, concomitant infections and diarrhoea are frequent complications resulting in adverse outcome. We examined the clinical and laboratory features on admission and outcome of children with SAM and diarrhoea at a Kenyan district hospital.A 4-year prospective descriptive study involving 1,206 children aged 6 months to 12 years, hospitalized with SAM and managed in accordance with WHO guidelines. Data on clinical features, haematological, biochemical and microbiological findings for children with diarrhoea (≥ 3 watery stools/day) were systematically collected and analyzed to identify risk factors associated with poor outcome.At admission 592 children (49%) had diarrhoea of which 122 (21%) died compared to 72/614 (12%) deaths in those without diarrhoea at admission (Χ(2) = 17.6 p<0.001). A further 187 (16%) children developed diarrhoea after 48 hours of admission and 33 died (18%). Any diarrhoea during admission resulted in a significantly higher mortality 161/852 (19%) than those uncomplicated by diarrhoea 33/351 (9%) (Χ(2) = 16.6 p<0.001). Features associated with a fatal outcome in children presenting with diarrhoea included bacteraemia, hyponatraemia, low mid-upper arm circumference <10 cm, hypoxia, hypokalaemia and oedema. Bacteraemia had the highest risk of death (adjusted OR 6.1; 95% C.I 2.3, 16.3 p<0.001); and complicated 24 (20%) of fatalities. Positive HIV antibody status was more frequent in cases with diarrhoea at admission (23%) than those without (15%, Χ(2) = 12.0 p = 0.001) but did not increase the risk of death in diarrhoea cases.Children with SAM complicated by diarrhoea had a higher risk of death than those who did not have diarrhoea during their hospital stay. Further operational and clinical research is needed to reduce mortality in children with SAM in the given setting.",
        "Epigenetic markings acquired in early life may have phenotypic consequences later in development through their role in transcriptional regulation with relevance to the developmental origins of diseases including obesity. The goal of this study was to investigate whether DNA methylation levels at birth are associated with body size later in childhood.A study design involving two birth cohorts was used to conduct transcription profiling followed by DNA methylation analysis in peripheral blood. Gene expression analysis was undertaken in 24 individuals whose biological samples and clinical data were collected at a mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of 12.35 (0.95) years, the upper and lower tertiles of body mass index (BMI) were compared with a mean (SD) BMI difference of 9.86 (2.37) kg/m(2). This generated a panel of differentially expressed genes for DNA methylation analysis which was then undertaken in cord blood DNA in 178 individuals with body composition data prospectively collected at a mean (SD) age of 9.83 (0.23) years. Twenty-nine differentially expressed genes (>1.2-fold and p<10(-4)) were analysed to determine DNA methylation levels at 1-3 sites per gene. Five genes were unmethylated and DNA methylation in the remaining 24 genes was analysed using linear regression with bootstrapping. Methylation in 9 of the 24 (37.5%) genes studied was associated with at least one index of body composition (BMI, fat mass, lean mass, height) at age 9 years, although only one of these associations remained after correction for multiple testing (ALPL with height, p(Corrected) = 0.017).DNA methylation patterns in cord blood show some association with altered gene expression, body size and composition in childhood. The observed relationship is correlative and despite suggestion of a mechanistic epigenetic link between in utero life and later phenotype, further investigation is required to establish causality.",
        "The insulin (INS) region is the second most important locus associated with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). The study of the DNA methylation pattern of the 7 CpGs proximal to the TSS in the INS gene promoter revealed that T1D patients have a lower level of methylation of CpG -19, -135 and -234 (p = 2.10(-16)) and a higher methylation of CpG -180 than controls, while methylation was comparable for CpG -69, -102, -206. The magnitude of the hypomethylation relative to a control population was 8-15% of the corresponding levels in controls and was correlated in CpGs -19 and -135 (r = 0.77) and CpG -135 and -234 (r = 0.65). 70/485 (14%) of T1D patients had a simultaneous decrease in methylation of CpG -19, -135, -234 versus none in 317 controls. CpG methylation did not correlate with glycated hemoglobin or with T1D duration. The methylation of CpG -69, -102, -180, -206, but not CpG -19, -135, -234 was strongly influenced by the cis-genotype at rs689, a SNP known to show a strong association with T1D. We hypothesize that part of this genetic association could in fact be mediated at the statistical and functional level by the underlying changes in neighboring CpG methylation. Our observation of a CpG-specific, locus-specific methylation pattern, although it can provide an epigenetic biomarker of a multifactorial disease, does not indicate whether the reported epigenetic pattern preexists or follows the establishment of T1D. To explore the effect of chronic hyperglycemia on CpG methylation, we studied non obese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who were found to have decreased CpG-19 methylation versus age-matched controls, similar to T1D (p = 2.10(-6)) but increased CpG-234 methylation (p = 5.10(-8)), the opposite of T1D. The causality and natural history of the different epigenetic changes associated with T1D or T2D remain to be determined.",
        "Several different interventions improve depressed mood, including medication and environmental factors such as regular physical exercise. The molecular pathways underlying these effects are still not fully understood. In this study, we sought to identify shared mechanisms underlying antidepressant interventions. We studied three groups of mice: mice treated with a widely used antidepressant drug--fluoxetine, mice engaged in voluntary exercise, and mice living in an enriched environment. The hippocampi of treated mice were investigated at the molecular and cellular levels. Mice treated with fluoxetine and mice who exercised daily showed, not only similar antidepressant behavior, but also similar changes in gene expression and hippocampal neurons. These changes were not observed in mice with environmental enrichment. An increase in neurogenesis and dendritic spine density was observed following four weeks of fluoxetine treatment and voluntary exercise. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed four different modules of co-expressed genes that were correlated with the antidepressant effect. This network analysis enabled us to identify genes involved in the molecular pathways underlying the effects of fluoxetine and exercise. The existence of both neuronal and gene expression changes common to antidepressant drug and exercise suggests a shared mechanism underlying their effect. Further studies of these findings may be used to uncover the molecular mechanisms of depression, and to identify new avenues of therapy.",
        "Copy number variations (CNVs) are genomic regions that have added (duplications) or deleted (deletions) genetic material. They may overlap genes affecting their function and have been shown to be associated with disease. We previously investigated the role of CNVs in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and National Institute of Aging-Late Onset AD/National Cell Repository for AD (NIA-LOAD/NCRAD) Family Study participants, and identified a number of genes overlapped by CNV calls. To confirm the findings and identify other potential candidate regions, we analyzed array data from a unique cohort of 1617 Caucasian participants (1022 AD cases and 595 controls) who were clinically characterized and whose diagnosis was neuropathologically verified. All DNA samples were extracted from brain tissue. CNV calls were generated and subjected to quality control (QC). 728 cases and 438 controls who passed all QC measures were included in case/control association analyses including candidate gene and genome-wide approaches. Rates of deletions and duplications did not significantly differ between cases and controls. Case-control association identified a number of previously reported regions (CHRFAM7A, RELN and DOPEY2) as well as a new gene (HLA-DRA). Meta-analysis of CHRFAM7A indicated a significant association of the gene with AD and/or MCI risk (P = 0.006, odds ratio = 3.986 (95% confidence interval 1.490-10.667)). A novel APP gene duplication was observed in one case sample. Further investigation of the identified genes in independent and larger samples is warranted.",
        "The canonical flow of visual signals proceeds from outer to inner retina (photoreceptors → bipolar cells → ganglion cells). However, melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells are photosensitive and functional sustained light signaling to retinal dopaminergic interneurons persists in the absence of rods and cones. Here we show that the sustained-type light response of retinal dopamine neurons requires melanopsin and that the response is mediated by AMPA-type glutamate receptors, defining a retrograde retinal visual signaling pathway that fully reverses the usual flow of light signals in retinal circuits.",
        "We present a method to discover discriminative brain metabolism patterns in [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) scans, facilitating the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In the work, the term \"pattern\" stands for a certain brain region that characterizes a target group of patients and can be used for a classification as well as interpretation purposes. Thus, it can be understood as a so-called \"region of interest (ROI)\". In the literature, an ROI is often found by a given brain atlas that defines a number of brain regions, which corresponds to an anatomical approach. The present work introduces a semi-data-driven approach that is based on learning the characteristics of the given data, given some prior anatomical knowledge. A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and model selection are combined to return a clustering of voxels that may serve for the definition of ROIs. Experiments on both an in-house dataset and data of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) suggest that the proposed approach arrives at a better diagnosis than a merely anatomical approach or conventional statistical hypothesis testing.",
        "This research resulted from the determination that MCZ 8791 is a specimen of Deinonychus antirrhopus between one and two years of age and that the morphological variations within particular growth stages of this taxon have yet to be described. The primary goal of the research is to identify ontogenetic variations in this taxon. Histological analyses determined that the Deinonychus specimens AMNH 3015 and MOR 1178 were adults. Comparisons are made between MCZ 8791 and these adult specimens. The holotype, YPM 5205, and the other associated specimens of this taxon within the YPM collection are similar in size and morphology to AMNH 3015. Further comparisons were made with the three partial specimens OMNH 50268, MCZ 4371, and MOR 1182. Although these specimens represent only a partial ontogenetic series, a number of morphological variations can be described. One secondary goal of this research is to compare the known pattern of variable, informative, ontogenetic characters in MCZ 8791 to a similar pattern of morphological characters in the sub-adult dromaeosaurid specimen Bambiraptor feinbergorum, AMNH FR: 30556. If the characters that have been determined to represent variable juvenile morphology in the ontogeny of Deinonychus are exhibited in Bambiraptor, this study will begin the process of determining whether a similar, conservative, ontogenetic pattern exists throughout the rest of Dromaeosauridae. If defensible, it may reduce the number of sympatric taxa within this clade. The other secondary goal relates to the forelimb function. The approximate body size, forelimb length, wrist development, and the presence of a more prominent olecranon on the ulna of MCZ 8791 support the hypothesis that juveniles of this taxon possessed some form of flight capability.",
        "Algae are at the base of the aquatic food chain, producing the food resources that fish are adapted to consume. Previous studies have proven that the inclusion of small amounts (<10% of the diet) of algae in fish feed (aquafeed) resulted in positive effects in growth performance and feed utilisation efficiency. Marine algae have also been shown to possess functional activities, helping in the mediation of lipid metabolism, and therefore are increasingly studied in human and animal nutrition. The aim of this study was to assess the potentials of two commercially available algae derived products (dry algae meal), Verdemin (derived from Ulva ohnoi) and Rosamin (derived from diatom Entomoneis spp.) for their possible inclusion into diet of Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar). Fish performances, feed efficiency, lipid metabolism and final product quality were assessed to investigated the potential of the two algae products (in isolation at two inclusion levels, 2.5% and 5%, or in combination), in experimental diets specifically formulated with low fish meal and fish oil content. The results indicate that inclusion of algae product Verdemin and Rosamin at level of 2.5 and 5.0% did not cause any major positive, nor negative, effect in Atlantic Salmon growth and feed efficiency. An increase in the omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LC-PUFA) content in whole body of fish fed 5% Rosamin was observed.",
        "Although increased prevalence of transfusion transmissible infections (TTI) among \"men who have sex with men\" (MSM) has been well documented, the exclusion of MSM as blood donors is contested. The aim of this systematic review is to find studies that describe the risk of TTI in MSM blood donors.We searched MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cinahl, and Web of Science, and used GRADE for determining evidence quality. We included studies comparing MSM and non-MSM blood donors (or people eligible to give blood), living in areas most relevant for our Blood Service.Out of 18 987 articles, 14 observational studies were included. Two studies directly compared MSM with non-MSM donors showing that MSM donors have a statistically significant higher risk of HIV-1 infections. In one of these studies it was shown that this was related to recent (< 12 months) MSM contact. In two additional studies no evidence was shown in favour of a certain deferral period for MSM. Ten studies, applying permanent deferral for MSM, compared infected versus non-infected donors. One study found that MSM is a statistically significant risk factor for HIV-1 infection in blood donors. For other TTI such as HBV or HCV, an increased risk of infection could not be demonstrated, because the precision of the results was affected by the low numbers of donors with MSM as risk factor, or because of risk of bias in the included studies. All studies included low level evidence, because of risk of bias and imprecision of the results.High-quality studies investigating the risk of TTI in MSM who donate blood are scarce. The available evidence suggests a link between MSM blood donors and HIV-1 infection, but is too limited to be able to unambiguously/clearly recommend a certain deferral policy.",
        "Despite the marked increase of diverticulosis, its risk factors have not been adequately elucidated. We therefore aim to identify significantly associated factors with diverticulosis. We also aim to investigate the present state of diverticulosis in Japan.We reviewed the medical records from 1990 to 2010 that included the data of consecutive 62,503 asymptomatic colonoscopy examinees from the general population in Japan. Most recent 3,327 examinees were analyzed with 16 background factors.Among the 62,503 subjects (47,325 men and 15,178 women; 52.1 ± 9.2 years old), diverticulosis was detected in 11,771 subjects (18.8%; 10,023 men and 1,748 women). The incidences of diverticulosis in 1990-2000 and 2001-2010 were respectively 13.0% (3,771 of 29,071) and 23.9% (8,000 of 33,432): the latter was much higher than the former in all age groups and for both genders. Considering the anatomical locations of colorectal diverticula, left-sided ones have markedly increased with age but not significantly changed with times. Univariate analyses of the 3,327 subjects showed significant association of diverticulosis with four basic factors (age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure), three life style-related factor (smoking, drinking, severe weight increase in adulthood), and two blood test values (triglyceride, HbA1c). The multiple logistic analysis calculating standardized coefficients (β) and odds ratio (OR) demonstrated that age (β = 0.217-0.674, OR = 1.24-1.96), male gender (β = 0.185, OR = 1.20), smoking (β = 0.142-0.200, OR = 1.15-1.22), severe weight increase in adulthood (β = 0.153, OR = 1.17), HbA1c (β = 0.136, OR = 1.15), drinking (β = 0.109, OR = 1.11), and serum triglyceride (β = 0.098, OR = 1.10) showed significantly positive association with diverticulosis whereas body mass index and blood pressure did not.The large-scale data of asymptomatic colonoscopy examinees from the general population from 1990 to 2010 indicated that the prevalence of diverticulosis is still increasing in Japan. Age, male gender, smoking, severe weight increase in adulthood, serum HbA1c, drinking, and serum triglyceride showed significant positive association with diverticulosis.",
        "Although cell therapy of the failing heart by intramyocardial injections of myoblasts to results in regenerative benefit, it has also been associated with undesired and prospectively fatal arrhythmias. We hypothesized that intramyocardial injections of myoblasts could enhance inflammatory reactivity and facilitate electrical cardiac abnormalities that can be reduced by epicardial myoblast sheet delivery. In a rat model of ischemic heart failure, myoblast therapy either by intramyocardial injections or epicardial cell sheets was given 2 weeks after occlusion of the coronary artery. Ventricular premature contractions (VPCs) were assessed, using an implanted three-lead electrocardiograph at 1, 7, and 14 days after therapy, and 16-point epicardial electropotential mapping (EEPM) was used to evaluate ventricular arrhythmogenicity under isoproterenol stress. Cardiac functioning was assessed by echocardiography. Both transplantation groups showed therapeutic benefit over sham therapy. However, VPCs were more frequent in the Injection group on day 1 and day 14 after therapy than in animals receiving epicardial or sham therapy (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). EEPM under isoproterenol stress showed macroreentry at the infarct border area, leading to ventricular tachycardias in the Injection group, but not in the myoblast sheet- or sham-treated groups (p = 0.045). Both transplantation types modified the myocardial cytokine expression profile. In animals receiving epicardial myoblast therapy, selective reductions in the expressions of interferon gamma, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL12 were observed, accompanied by reduced infiltration of inflammatory CD11b- and CD68-positive leukocytes, compared with animals receiving myoblasts as intramyocardial injections. Intramyocardial myoblast delivery was associated with enhanced inflammatory and immunomodulatory reactivity and increased frequency of VPCs. In comparison to intramyocardial injection, the epicardial route may serve as the preferred method of skeletal myoblast transplantation to treat heart failure.",
        "The Ireviken event was one of the most intense extinction episodes that occurred during the mid-Paleozoic era. It had a strong global effect on a range of clades, with conodonts, graptolites and chitinozoans affected most. Using geophysical proxies and conodont species parameters of their temporal abundance structure we investigate how they affected the selectivity of conodont species survival during this calamity. After performing bivariate logistic analyses on 34 species of conodonts, we find three variables that were statistically significantly associated with their odds of survival. These namely include spectral exponents that describe degrees of autocorrelation in a time series, the skewness of species abundance distribution, and average environmental preferences, which are mostly determined by ancient water depths at sampling sites. Model selection of multivariate logistic models found the best model includes species local abundance skewness and substrate preference. A similar pattern is revealed through the regression tree analysis. The apparent extinction selectivity points to a possible causes of environmental deterioration during the Ireviken event. The significant positive relationship between extinction risk and preferential existence in deeper environments suggests the open ocean causal mechanisms of biotic stress that occurred during the Ireviken event. Marine regressions, which were previously suggested as a causal factor in this extinction episode, on theoretical grounds should have had higher impact on species living in near-shore environments, through the processes of habitat loss which are associated with decreases of shelfal areas. In addition, the significant positive correlations found between skewness of abundance distributions and spectral exponent values and the probability of species survival suggest that community and ecosystem processes (which controlled species abundance fluctuation patterns) were significantly related to selectivity processes of this smaller mass extinction event.",
        "Dilated cardiomyopathy is a disease of left ventricular dysfunction accompanied by impairment of the β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR) signal cascade. The disturbed β1-AR function may be based on an elevated sympathetic tone observed in patients with heart failure. Prolonged adrenergic stimulation may induce metabolic and electrophysiological disturbances in the myocardium, resulting in tachyarrhythmia that leads to the development of heart failure in human and sudden death. Hence, β1-AR is considered as a promising drug target but attempts to develop effective and specific drug against this tempting pharmaceutical target is slowed down due to the lack of 3D structure of Homo sapiens β1-AR (hsβADR1). This study encompasses elucidation of 3D structural and physicochemical properties of hsβADR1 via threading-based homology modeling. Furthermore, the docking performance of several docking programs including Surflex-Dock, FRED, and GOLD were validated by re-docking and cross-docking experiments. GOLD and Surflex-Dock performed best in re-docking and cross docking experiments, respectively. Consequently, Surflex-Dock was used to predict the binding modes of four hsβADR1 agonists. This study provides clear understanding of hsβADR1 structure and its binding mechanism, thus help in providing the remedial solutions of cardiovascular, effective treatment of asthma and other diseases caused by malfunctioning of the target protein.",
        "Inhibition of carcinogenesis may be a consequence of attenuation of oxidative stress via activation of antioxidant defence system, restoration and stabilization of tumour suppressor proteins along with modulation of inflammatory mediators. Previously we have delineated significant role of curcumin during its long term effect in regulation of glycolytic pathway and angiogenesis, which in turn results in prevention of cancer via modulation of stress activated genes. Present study was designed to investigate long term effect of curcumin in regulation of Nrf2 mediated phase-II antioxidant enzymes, tumour suppressor p53 and inflammation under oxidative tumour microenvironment in liver of T-cell lymphoma bearing mice. Inhibition of Nrf2 signalling observed during lymphoma progression, resulted in down regulation of phase II antioxidant enzymes, p53 as well as activation of inflammatory signals. Curcumin potentiated significant increase in Nrf2 activation. It restored activity of phase-II antioxidant enzymes like GST, GR, NQO1, and tumour suppressor p53 level. In addition, curcumin modulated inflammation via upregulation of TGF-β and reciprocal regulation of iNOS and COX2. The study suggests that during long term effect, curcumin leads to prevention of cancer by inducing phase-II antioxidant enzymes via activation of Nrf2 signalling, restoration of tumour suppressor p53 and modulation of inflammatory mediators like iNOS and COX2 in liver of lymphoma bearing mice.",
        "Many anti-cancer drugs fail in human trials despite showing efficacy in preclinical models. It is clear that the in vitro assays involving 2D monoculture do not reflect the complex extracellular matrix, chemical, and cellular microenvironment of the tumor tissue, and this may explain the failure of 2D models to predict clinical efficacy. We first optimized an in vitro microtumor model using a tumor-aligned ECM, a tumor-aligned medium, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer spheroids, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and human stromal cells to recapitulate the tissue architecture, chemical environment, and cellular organization of a growing and invading tumor. We assayed the microtumor for cell proliferation and invasion in a tumor-aligned extracellular matrix, exhibiting collagen deposition, acidity, glucose deprivation, and hypoxia. We found maximal proliferation and invasion when the multicellular spheroids were cultured in a tumor-aligned medium, having low pH and low glucose, with 10% fetal bovine serum under hypoxic conditions. In a 7-day assay, varying doses of fluorouracil or paclitaxel had differential effects on proliferation for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 tumor spheroids in microtumor compared to 2D and 3D monoculture. The microtumors exhibited a tumor morphology and drug response similar to published xenograft data, thus demonstrating a more physiologically predictive in vitro model.",
        "This paper studies how certain speculative transitions in financial markets can be ascribed to a symmetry break that happens in the collective decision making. Investors are assumed to be bounded rational, using a limited set of information including past price history and expectation on future dividends. Investment strategies are dynamically changed based on realized returns within a game theoretical scheme with Nash equilibria. In such a setting, markets behave as complex systems whose payoff reflect an intrinsic financial symmetry that guarantees equilibrium in price dynamics (fundamentalist state) until the symmetry is broken leading to bubble or anti-bubble scenarios (speculative state). We model such two-phase transition in a micro-to-macro scheme through a Ginzburg-Landau-based power expansion leading to a market temperature parameter which modulates the state transitions in the market. Via simulations we prove that transitions in the market price dynamics can be phenomenologically explained by the number of traders, the number of strategies and amount of information used by agents, all included in our market temperature parameter.",
        "Cysticidal drug treatment of viable Taenia solium brain parenchymal cysts leads to an acute pericystic host inflammatory response and blood brain barrier breakdown (BBB), commonly resulting in seizures. Naturally infected pigs, untreated or treated one time with praziquantel were sacrificed at 48 hr and 120 hr following the injection of Evans blue (EB) to assess the effect of treatment on larval parasites and surrounding tissue. Examination of harvested non encapsulated muscle cysts unexpectedly revealed one or more small, focal round region(s) of Evans blue dye infiltration (REBI) on the surface of otherwise non dye-stained muscle cysts. Histopathological analysis of REBI revealed focal areas of eosinophil-rich inflammatory infiltrates that migrated from the capsule into the tegument and internal structures of the parasite. In addition some encapsulated brain cysts, in which the presence of REBI could not be directly assessed, showed histopathology identical to that of the REBI. Muscle cysts with REBI were more frequent in pigs that had received praziquantel (6.6% of 3736 cysts; n = 6 pigs) than in those that were untreated (0.2% of 3172 cysts; n = 2 pigs). Similar results were found in the brain, where 20.7% of 29 cysts showed histopathology identical to muscle REBI cysts in praziquantel-treated pigs compared to the 4.3% of 47 cysts in untreated pigs. Closer examination of REBI infiltrates showed that EB was taken up only by eosinophils, a major component of the cellular infiltrates, which likely explains persistence of EB in the REBI. REBI likely represent early damaging host responses to T. solium cysts and highlight the focal nature of this initial host response and the importance of eosinophils at sites of host-parasite interaction. These findings suggest new avenues for immunomodulation to reduce inflammatory side effects of anthelmintic therapy.",
        "Improved understanding and quantification of social contact patterns that govern the transmission dynamics of respiratory viral infections has utility in the design of preventative and control measures such as vaccination and social distancing. The objective of this study was to quantify an age-specific matrix of contact rates for a predominantly rural low-income population that would support transmission dynamic modeling of respiratory viruses.From the population register of the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System, coastal Kenya, 150 individuals per age group (<1, 1-5, 6-15, 16-19, 20-49, 50 and above, in years) were selected by stratified random sampling and requested to complete a day long paper diary of physical contacts (e.g. touch or embrace). The sample was stratified by residence (rural-to-semiurban), month (August 2011 to January 2012, spanning seasonal changes in socio-cultural activities), and day of week. Usable diary responses were obtained from 568 individuals (∼50% of expected). The mean number of contacts per person per day was 17.7 (95% CI 16.7-18.7). Infants reported the lowest contact rates (mean 13.9, 95% CI 12.1-15.7), while primary school students (6-15 years) reported the highest (mean 20.1, 95% CI 18.0-22.2). Rates of contact were higher within groups of similar age (assortative), particularly within the primary school students and adults (20-49 years). Adults and older participants (>50 years) exhibited the highest inter-generational contacts. Rural contact rates were higher than semiurban (18.8 vs 15.6, p = 0.002), with rural primary school students having twice as many assortative contacts as their semiurban peers.This is the first age-specific contact matrix to be defined for tropical Sub-Saharan Africa and has utility in age-structured models to assess the potential impact of interventions for directly transmitted respiratory infections.",
        "The molecular determinants underpinning how hexaacylated lipid A and tetraacylated precursor lipid IVa activate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) are well understood, but how activation is induced by other lipid A species is less clear. Species specificity studies have clarified how TLR4/MD-2 recognises different lipid A structures, for example tetraacylated lipid IVa requires direct electrostatic interactions for agonism. In this study, we examine how pentaacylated lipopolysaccharide from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RSLPS) antagonises human TLR4/MD-2 and activates the horse receptor complex using a computational approach and cross-species mutagenesis. At a functional level, we show that RSLPS is a partial agonist at horse TLR4/MD-2 with greater efficacy than lipid IVa. These data suggest the importance of the additional acyl chain in RSLPS signalling. Based on docking analysis, we propose a model for positioning of the RSLPS lipid A moiety (RSLA) within the MD-2 cavity at the TLR4 dimer interface, which allows activity at the horse receptor complex. As for lipid IVa, RSLPS agonism requires species-specific contacts with MD-2 and TLR4, but the R2 chain of RSLA protrudes from the MD-2 pocket to contact the TLR4 dimer in the vicinity of proline 442. Our model explains why RSLPS is only partially dependent on horse TLR4 residue R385, unlike lipid IVa. Mutagenesis of proline 442 into a serine residue, as found in human TLR4, uncovers the importance of this site in RSLPS signalling; horse TLR4 R385G/P442S double mutation completely abolishes RSLPS activity without its counterpart, human TLR4 G384R/S441P, being able to restore it. Our data highlight the importance of subtle changes in ligand positioning, and suggest that TLR4 and MD-2 residues that may not participate directly in ligand binding can determine the signalling outcome of a given ligand. This indicates a cooperative binding mechanism within the receptor complex, which is becoming increasingly important in TLR signalling.",
        "In neonatal encephalopathy (NE), infectious co-morbidity is difficult to diagnose accurately, but may increase the vulnerability of the developing brain to hypoxia-ischemia. We developed a novel panel of species-specific real-time PCR assays to identify bloodstream pathogens amongst newborns with and without NE in Uganda.Multiplex real-time PCR assays for important neonatal bloodstream pathogens (gram positive and gram negative bacteria, cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus(HSV) and P. falciparum) were performed on whole blood taken from 202 encephalopathic and 101 control infants. Automated blood culture (BACTEC) was performed for all cases and unwell controls.Prevalence of pathogenic bacterial species amongst infants with NE was 3.6%, 6.9% and 8.9%, with culture, PCR and both tests in combination, respectively. More encephalopathic infants than controls had pathogenic bacterial species detected (8.9%vs2.0%, p = 0.028) using culture and PCR in combination. PCR detected bacteremia in 11 culture negative encephalopathic infants (3 Group B Streptococcus, 1 Group A Streptococcus, 1 Staphylococcus aureus and 6 Enterobacteriacae). Coagulase negative staphylococcus, frequently detected by PCR amongst case and control infants, was considered a contaminant. Prevalence of CMV, HSV and malaria amongst cases was low (1.5%, 0.5% and 0.5%, respectively).This real-time PCR panel detected more bacteremia than culture alone and provides a novel tool for detection of neonatal bloodstream pathogens that may be applied across a range of clinical situations and settings. Significantly more encephalopathic infants than controls had pathogenic bacterial species detected suggesting that infection may be an important risk factor for NE in this setting.",
        "Phonological awareness, letter knowledge, oral language (including sentence recall) and rapid automatised naming are acknowledged within-child predictors of literacy development. Separate research has identified family factors including socio-economic status, parents' level of education and family history. However, both approaches have left unexplained significant amounts of variance in literacy outcomes. This longitudinal study sought to improve prospective classification accuracy for young children at risk of literacy failure by adding two new family measures (parents' phonological awareness and parents' perceived self-efficacy), and then combining the within-child and family factors.Pre-literacy skills were measured in 102 four year olds (46 girls and 56 boys) at the beginning of Preschool, and then at the beginning and end of Kindergarten, when rapid automatised naming was also measured. Family factors data were collected at the beginning of Preschool, and children's literacy outcomes were measured at the end of Year 1 (age 6-7 years).Children from high-risk backgrounds showed poorer literacy outcomes than low-risk students, though three family factors (school socio-economic status, parents' phonological awareness, and family history) typically accounted for less Year 1 variance than the within-child factors. Combining these family factors with the end of Kindergarten within-child factors provided the most accurate classification (i.e., sensitivity = .85; specificity = .90; overall correct = .88).Our approach would identify at-risk children for intervention before they began to fail. Moreover, it would be cost-effective because although few at-risk children would be missed, allocation of unnecessary educational resources would be minimised.",
        "The JmjC domain-containing protein JMJD3/KDM6B catalyses the demethylation of H3K27me3 and H3K27me2. JMJD3 appears to be highly regulated at the transcriptional level and is upregulated in response to diverse stimuli such as differentiation inducers and stress signals. Accordingly, JMJD3 has been linked to the regulation of different biological processes such as differentiation of embryonic stem cells, inflammatory responses in macrophages, and induction of cellular senescence via regulation of the INK4A-ARF locus. Here we show here that JMJD3 interacts with the tumour suppressor protein p53. We find that the interaction is dependent on the p53 tetramerization domain. Following DNA damage, JMJD3 is transcriptionally upregulated and by performing genome-wide mapping of JMJD3, we demonstrate that it binds genes involved in basic cellular processes, as well as genes regulating cell cycle, response to stress and apoptosis. Moreover, we find that JMJD3 binding sites show significant overlap with p53 bound promoters and enhancer elements. The binding of JMJD3 to p53 target sites is increased in response to DNA damage, and we demonstrate that the recruitment of JMJD3 to these sites is dependent on p53 expression. Therefore, we propose a model in which JMJD3 is recruited to p53 responsive elements via its interaction with p53 and speculate that JMJD3 could act as a fail-safe mechanism to remove low levels of H3K27me3 and H3K27me2 to allow for efficient acetylation of H3K27.",
        "The orthodox role of the invariant chain (CD74; Ii) is in antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells, but enhanced CD8+ T cells responses have been reported after vaccination with vectored viral vaccines encoding a fusion of Ii to the antigen of interest. In this study we assessed whether fusion of the malarial antigen, ME-TRAP, to Ii could increase the vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell response. Following single or heterologous prime-boost vaccination of mice with a recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus vector, ChAd63, or recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), higher frequencies of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were observed, with the largest increases observed following a ChAd63-MVA heterologous prime-boost regimen. Studies in non-human primates confirmed the ability of Ii-fusion to augment the T cell response, where a 4-fold increase was maintained up to 11 weeks after the MVA boost. Of the numerous different approaches explored to increase vectored vaccine induced immunogenicity over the years, fusion to the invariant chain showed a consistent enhancement in CD8+ T cell responses across different animal species and may therefore find application in the development of vaccines against human malaria and other diseases where high levels of cell-mediated immunity are required.",
        "Nucleic acid testing (NAT) for malaria parasites is an increasingly recommended diagnostic endpoint in clinical trials of vaccine and drug candidates and is also important in surveillance of malaria control and elimination efforts. A variety of reported NAT assays have been described, yet no formal external quality assurance (EQA) program provides validation for the assays in use. Here, we report results of an EQA exercise for malaria NAT assays. Among five centers conducting controlled human malaria infection trials, all centers achieved 100% specificity and demonstrated limits of detection consistent with each laboratory's pre-stated expectations. Quantitative bias of reported results compared to expected results was generally <0.5 log10 parasites/mL except for one laboratory where the EQA effort identified likely reasons for a general quantitative shift. The within-laboratory variation for all assays was low at <10% coefficient of variation across a range of parasite densities. Based on this study, we propose to create a Molecular Malaria Quality Assessment program that fulfills the need for EQA of malaria NAT assays worldwide.",
        "Febrile illnesses are pre-eminent contributors to morbidity and mortality among children in South-East Asia but the causes are poorly understood. We determined the causes of fever in children hospitalised in Siem Reap province, Cambodia.A one-year prospective study of febrile children admitted to Angkor Hospital for Children, Siem Reap. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and outcome data were comprehensively analysed. Between October 12(th) 2009 and October 12(th) 2010 there were 1225 episodes of febrile illness in 1180 children. Median (IQR) age was 2.0 (0.8-6.4) years, with 850 (69%) episodes in children <5 years. Common microbiological diagnoses were dengue virus (16.2%), scrub typhus (7.8%), and Japanese encephalitis virus (5.8%). 76 (6.3%) episodes had culture-proven bloodstream infection, including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (22 isolates, 1.8%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (13, 1.1%), Escherichia coli (8, 0.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (7, 0.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (6, 0.5%) and Burkholderia pseudomallei (6, 0.5%). There were 69 deaths (5.6%), including those due to clinically diagnosed pneumonia (19), dengue virus (5), and melioidosis (4). 10 of 69 (14.5%) deaths were associated with culture-proven bloodstream infection in logistic regression analyses (odds ratio for mortality 3.4, 95% CI 1.6-6.9). Antimicrobial resistance was prevalent, particularly in S. enterica Typhi, (where 90% of isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, and 86% were multi-drug resistant). Comorbid undernutrition was present in 44% of episodes and a major risk factor for acute mortality (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.2), as were HIV infection and cardiac disease.We identified a microbiological cause of fever in almost 50% of episodes in this large study of community-acquired febrile illness in hospitalized children in Cambodia. The range of pathogens, antimicrobial susceptibility, and co-morbidities associated with mortality described will be of use in the development of rational guidelines for infectious disease treatment and control in Cambodia and South-East Asia.",
        "Early warning scores (EWS) are widely used in well-resourced healthcare settings to identify patients at risk of mortality. The Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) is a well-known EWS used comprehensively in the United Kingdom. The HOTEL score (Hypotension, Oxygen saturation, Temperature, ECG abnormality, Loss of independence) was developed and tested in a European cohort; however, its validity is unknown in resource limited settings. This study compared the performance of both scores and suggested modifications to enhance accuracy.A prospective cohort study of adults (≥18 yrs) admitted to medical wards at a Malawian hospital. Primary outcome was mortality within three days. Performance of MEWS and HOTEL were assessed using ROC analysis. Logistic regression analysis identified important predictors of mortality and from this a new score was defined.Three-hundred-and-two patients were included. Fifty-one (16.9%) died within three days of admission. With a cut-point ≥2, the HOTEL score had sensitivity 70.6% (95% CI: 56.2 to 82.5) and specificity 59.4% (95% CI: 53.0 to 65.5), and was superior to MEWS (cut-point ≥5); sensitivity: 58.8% (95% CI: 44.2 to 72.4), specificity: 56.2% (95% CI: 49.8 to 62.4). The new score, dubbed TOTAL (Tachypnoea, Oxygen saturation, Temperature, Alert, Loss of independence), showed slight improvement with a cut-point ≥2; sensitivity 76.5% (95% CI: 62.5 to 87.2) and specificity 67.3% (95% CI: 61.1 to 73.1).Using an EWS generated in developed healthcare systems in resource limited settings results in loss of sensitivity and specificity. A score based on predictors of mortality specific to the Malawian population showed enhanced accuracy but not enough to warrant clinical use. Despite an assumption of common physiological responses, disease and population differences seem to strongly determine the performance of EWS. Local validation and impact assessment of these scores should precede their adoption in resource limited settings.",
        "Pim-1 kinase, a serine/threonine protein kinase encoded by the pim proto-oncogene, is involved in several signalling pathways such as the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Many cancer types show high expression levels of Pim kinases and particularly Pim-1 has been linked to the initiation and progression of the malignant phenotype. In several cancer tissues somatic Pim-1 mutants have been identified. These natural variants are nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, variations of a single nucleotide occurring in the coding region and leading to amino acid substitutions. In this study we investigated the effect of amino acid substitution on the structural stability and on the activity of Pim-1 kinase. We expressed and purified some of the mutants of Pim-1 kinase that are expressed in cancer tissues and reported in the single nucleotide polymorphisms database. The point mutations in the variants significantly affect the conformation of the native state of Pim-1. All the mutants, expressed as soluble recombinant proteins, show a decreased thermal and thermodynamic stability and a lower activation energy values for kinase activity. The decreased stability accompanied by an increased flexibility suggests that Pim-1 variants may be involved in a wider network of protein interactions. All mutants bound ATP and ATP mimetic inhibitors with comparable IC50 values suggesting that the studied Pim-1 kinase mutants can be efficiently targeted with inhibitors developed for the wild type protein.",
        "The prevalence of obesity and associated health conditions is increasing in the developed world. Obesity is related to atrophy and dysfunction of the hippocampus and hippocampal lesions may lead to increased appetite and weight gain. The hippocampus is connected via the fornix tract to the hypothalamus, orbitofrontal cortex, and the nucleus accumbens, all key structures for homeostatic and reward related control of food intake. The present study employed diffusion MRI tractography to investigate the relationship between microstructural properties of the fornix and variation in Body Mass Index (BMI), within normal and overweight ranges, in a group of community-dwelling older adults (53-93 years old). Larger BMI was associated with larger axial and mean diffusivity in the fornix (r = 0.64 and r = 0.55 respectively), relationships that were most pronounced in overweight individuals. Moreover, controlling for age, education, cognitive performance, blood pressure and global brain volume increased these correlations. Similar associations were not found in the parahippocampal cingulum, a comparison temporal association pathway. Thus, microstructural changes in fornix white matter were observed in older adults with increasing BMI levels from within normal to overweight ranges, so are not exclusively related to obesity. We propose that hippocampal-hypothalamic-prefrontal interactions, mediated by the fornix, contribute to the healthy functioning of networks involved in food intake control. The fornix, in turn, may display alterations in microstructure that reflect weight gain.",
        "We employed a random mutagenesis approach to identify novel monogenic determinants of type 2 diabetes. Here we show that haplo-insufficiency of the histone methyltransferase myeloid-lineage leukemia (Mll2/Wbp7) gene causes type 2 diabetes in the mouse. We have shown that mice heterozygous for two separate mutations in the SET domain of Mll2 or heterozygous Mll2 knockout mice were hyperglycaemic, hyperinsulinaemic and developed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Consistent with previous Mll2 knockout studies, mice homozygous for either ENU mutation (or compound heterozygotes) died during embryonic development at 9.5-14.5 days post coitum. Heterozygous deletion of Mll2 induced in the adult mouse results in a normal phenotype suggesting that changes in chromatin methylation during development result in the adult phenotype. Mll2 has been shown to regulate a small subset of genes, a number of which Neurod1, Enpp1, Slc27a2, and Plcxd1 are downregulated in adult mutant mice. Our results demonstrate that histone H3K4 methyltransferase Mll2 is a component of the genetic regulation necessary for glucose homeostasis, resulting in a specific disease pattern linking chromatin modification with causes and progression of type 2 diabetes, providing a basis for its further understanding at the molecular level.",
        "A-type lamins encoded by LMNA form a structural fibrillar meshwork within the mammalian nucleus. How this nuclear organization may influence the execution of biological processes involving DNA transactions remains unclear. Here, we characterize changes in the dynamics and biochemical interactions of lamin A/C after DNA damage. We find that DNA breakage reduces the mobility of nucleoplasmic GFP-lamin A throughout the nucleus as measured by dynamic fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy in living cells, suggestive of incorporation into stable macromolecular complexes, but does not induce the focal accumulation of GFP-lamin A at damage sites. Using a proximity ligation assay and biochemical analyses, we show that lamin A engages chromatin via histone H2AX and its phosphorylated form (γH2AX) induced by DNA damage, and that these interactions are enhanced after DNA damage. Finally, we use three-dimensional time-lapse imaging to show that LMNA inactivation significantly reduces the positional stability of DNA repair foci in living cells. This defect is partially rescued by the stable expression of GFP-lamin A. Thus collectively, our findings suggest that the dynamic structural meshwork formed by A-type lamins anchors sites of DNA repair in mammalian nuclei, providing fresh insight into the control of DNA transactions by nuclear structural organization.",
        "CALM (clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein) is a cargo-selective adaptor for the post-Golgi R-SNAREs VAMPs 2, 3, and 8, and it also regulates the size of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles at the plasma membrane. The present study has two objectives: to determine whether CALM can sort additional VAMPs, and to investigate whether VAMP sorting contributes to CALM-dependent vesicle size regulation. Using a flow cytometry-based endocytosis efficiency assay, we demonstrate that CALM is also able to sort VAMPs 4 and 7, even though they have sorting signals for other clathrin adaptors. CALM homologues are present in nearly every eukaryote, suggesting that the CALM family may have evolved as adaptors for retrieving all post-Golgi VAMPs from the plasma membrane. Using a knockdown/rescue system, we show that wild-type CALM restores normal VAMP sorting in CALM-depleted cells, but that two non-VAMP-binding mutants do not. However, when we assayed the effect of CALM depletion on coated pit morphology, using a fluorescence microscopy-based assay, we found that the two mutants were as effective as wild-type CALM. Thus, we can uncouple the sorting function of CALM from its structural role.",
        "Keratin 7 (K7) is a Type II member of the keratin superfamily and despite its widespread expression in different types of simple and transitional epithelia, its functional role in vivo remains elusive, in part due to the lack of any appropriate mouse models or any human diseases that are associated with KRT7 gene mutations. Using conventional gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells, we report here the generation and characterisation of the first K7 knockout mouse. Loss of K7 led to increased proliferation of the bladder urothelium although this was not associated with hyperplasia. K18, a presumptive type I assembly partner for K7, showed reduced expression in the bladder whereas K20, a marker of the terminally differentiated superficial urothelial cells was transcriptionally up-regulated. No other epithelia were seen to be adversely affected by the loss of K7 and western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy analysis revealed that the expression of K8, K18, K19 and K20 were not altered in the absence of K7, with the exception of the kidney where there was reduced K18 expression.",
        "Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is an important cause of inherited mitochondrial blindness among young adults. The majority of patients carry one of three mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) point mutations: m.3460G>A, m.11778G>A and m.14484T>C, all of which affect critical complex I subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. LHON is characterised by marked incomplete penetrance, clearly implying that the mtDNA mutation is insufficient on its own to trigger retinal ganglion cell dysfunction and visual loss. In this case series of three affected patients harbouring the m.11778G>A mutation, we provide evidence suggesting that raised intraocular pressure could be a risk factor triggering visual loss in at-risk LHON carriers.",
        "Modelling is widely used to inform decisions about management of malaria and acute febrile illnesses. Most models depend on estimates of the probability that untreated patients with malaria or bacterial illnesses will progress to severe disease or death. However, data on these key parameters are lacking and assumptions are frequently made based on expert opinion. Widely diverse opinions can lead to conflicting outcomes in models they inform.A Delphi survey was conducted with malaria experts aiming to reach consensus on key parameters for public health and economic models, relating to the outcome of untreated febrile illnesses. Survey questions were stratified by malaria transmission intensity, patient age, and HIV prevalence. The impact of the variability in opinion on decision models is illustrated with a model previously used to assess the cost-effectiveness of malaria rapid diagnostic tests. Some consensus was reached around the probability that patients from higher transmission settings with untreated malaria would progress to severe disease (median 3%, inter-quartile range (IQR) 1-5%), and the probability that a non-malaria illness required antibiotics in areas of low HIV prevalence (median 20%). Children living in low transmission areas were considered to be at higher risk of progressing to severe malaria (median 30%, IQR 10-58%) than those from higher transmission areas (median 13%, IQR 7-30%). Estimates of the probability of dying from severe malaria were high in all settings (medians 60-73%). However, opinions varied widely for most parameters, and did not converge on resurveying.This study highlights the uncertainty around potential consequences of untreated malaria and bacterial illnesses. The lack of consensus on most parameters, the wide range of estimates, and the impact of variability in estimates on model outputs, demonstrate the importance of sensitivity analysis for decision models employing expert opinion. Results of such models should be interpreted cautiously. The diversity of expert opinion should be recognised when policy options are debated.",
        "Streptococcus suis infection, an emerging zoonosis, is an increasing public health problem across South East Asia and the most common cause of acute bacterial meningitis in adults in Vietnam. Little is known of the risk factors underlying the disease.A case-control study with appropriate hospital and matched community controls for each patient was conducted between May 2006 and June 2009. Potential risk factors were assessed using a standardized questionnaire and investigation of throat and rectal S. suis carriage in cases, controls and their pigs, using real-time PCR and culture of swab samples. We recruited 101 cases of S. suis meningitis, 303 hospital controls and 300 community controls. By multivariate analysis, risk factors identified for S. suis infection as compared to either control group included eating \"high risk\" dishes, including such dishes as undercooked pig blood and pig intestine (OR(1) = 2.22; 95%CI = [1.15-4.28] and OR(2) = 4.44; 95%CI = [2.15-9.15]), occupations related to pigs (OR(1) = 3.84; 95%CI = [1.32-11.11] and OR(2) = 5.52; 95%CI = [1.49-20.39]), and exposures to pigs or pork in the presence of skin injuries (OR(1) = 7.48; 95%CI = [1.97-28.44] and OR(2) = 15.96; 95%CI = [2.97-85.72]). S. suis specific DNA was detected in rectal and throat swabs of 6 patients and was cultured from 2 rectal samples, but was not detected in such samples of 1522 healthy individuals or patients without S. suis infection.This case control study, the largest prospective epidemiological assessment of this disease, has identified the most important risk factors associated with S. suis bacterial meningitis to be eating 'high risk' dishes popular in parts of Asia, occupational exposure to pigs and pig products, and preparation of pork in the presence of skin lesions. These risk factors can be addressed in public health campaigns aimed at preventing S. suis infection.",
        "The key roles played by the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in plasticity and cognition underscore this membrane protein as a relevant target to develop cognitive-enhancing drugs. However, NCAM is a structurally and functionally complex molecule with multiple domains engaged in a variety of actions, which raise the question as to which NCAM fragment should be targeted. Synthetic NCAM mimetic peptides that mimic NCAM sequences relevant to specific interactions allow identification of the most promising targets within NCAM. Recently, a decapeptide ligand of NCAM--plannexin, which mimics a homophilic trans-binding site in Ig2 and binds to Ig3--was developed as a tool for studying NCAM's trans-interactions. In this study, we investigated plannexin's ability to affect neural plasticity and memory formation. We found that plannexin facilitates neurite outgrowth in primary hippocampal neuronal cultures and improves spatial learning in rats, both under basal conditions and under conditions involving a deficit in a key plasticity-promoting posttranslational modification of NCAM, its polysialylation. We also found that plannexin enhances excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal area CA1, where it also increases the number of mushroom spines and the synaptic expression of the AMPAR subunits GluA1 and GluA2. Altogether, these findings provide compelling evidence that plannexin is an important facilitator of synaptic functional, structural and molecular plasticity in the hippocampal CA1 region, highlighting the fragment in NCAM's Ig3 module where plannexin binds as a novel target for the development of cognition-enhancing drugs.",
        "Genetic factors are important determinants of overweight. We examined whether there are differential effect sizes depending on children's body composition.We analysed data of n = 4,837 children recorded in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), applying quantile regression with sex- and age-specific standard deviation scores (SDS) of body mass index (BMI) or with body fat mass index and fat-free mass index at 9 years as outcome variables and an \"obesity-risk-allele score\" based on eight genetic variants known to be associated with childhood BMI as the explanatory variable.The quantile regression coefficients increased with increasing child's BMI-SDS and fat mass index percentiles, indicating larger effects of the genetic factors at higher percentiles. While the associations with BMI-SDS were of similar size in medium and high BMI quantiles (40th percentile and above), effect sizes with fat mass index increased over the whole fat mass index distribution. For example, the fat mass index of a normal-weight (50th percentile) child was increased by 0.13 kg/m(2) (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.09, 0.16) per additional allele, compared to 0.24 kg/m(2) per allele (95% CI: 0.15, 0.32) in children at the 90th percentile. The genetic associations with fat-free mass index were weaker and the quantile regression effects less pronounced than those on fat mass index.Genetic risk factors for childhood overweight appear to have greater effects on fatter children. Interaction of known genetic factors with environmental or unknown genetic factors might provide a potential explanation of these findings.",
        "Migration from rural areas of India contributes to urbanisation and lifestyle change, and dietary changes may increase the risk of obesity and chronic diseases. We tested the hypothesis that rural-to-urban migrants have different macronutrient and food group intake to rural non-migrants, and that migrants have a diet more similar to urban non-migrants.The diets of migrants of rural origin, their rural dwelling sibs, and those of urban origin together with their urban dwelling sibs were assessed by an interviewer-administered semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. A total of 6,509 participants were included. Median energy intake in the rural, migrant and urban groups was 2731, 3078, and 3224 kcal respectively for men, and 2153, 2504, and 2644 kcal for women (p<0.001). A similar trend was seen for overall intake of fat, protein and carbohydrates (p<0.001), though differences in the proportion of energy from these nutrients were <2%. Migrant and urban participants reported up to 80% higher fruit and vegetable intake than rural participants (p<0.001), and up to 35% higher sugar intake (p<0.001). Meat and dairy intake were higher in migrant and urban participants than rural participants (p<0.001), but varied by region. Sibling-pair analyses confirmed these results. There was no evidence of associations with time in urban area.Rural to urban migration appears to be associated with both positive (higher fruit and vegetables intake) and negative (higher energy and fat intake) dietary changes. These changes may be of relevance to cardiovascular health and warrant public health interventions.",
        "Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) catalyse oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). IDH1 functions in the cytosol and peroxisomes, whereas IDH2 and IDH3 are both localized in the mitochondria. Heterozygous somatic mutations in IDH1 occur at codon 132 in 70% of grade II-III gliomas and secondary glioblastomas (GBMs), and in 5% of primary GBMs. Mutations in IDH2 at codon 172 are present in grade II-III gliomas at a low frequency. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations cause both loss of normal enzyme function and gain-of-function, causing reduction of α-KG to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG) which accumulates. Excess hydroxyglutarate (2HG) can also be caused by germline mutations in D- and L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenases (D2HGDH and L2HGDH). If loss of IDH function is critical for tumourigenesis, we might expect some tumours to acquire somatic IDH3 mutations. Alternatively, if 2HG accumulation is critical, some tumours might acquire somatic D2HGDH or L2HGDH mutations. We therefore screened 47 glioblastoma samples looking for changes in these genes. Although IDH1 R132H was identified in 12% of samples, no mutations were identified in any of the other genes. This suggests that mutations in IDH3, D2HGDH and L2HGDH do not occur at an appreciable frequency in GBM. One explanation is simply that mono-allelic IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur more frequently by chance than the bi-allelic mutations expected at IDH3, D2HGDH and L2HGDH. Alternatively, both loss of IDH function and 2HG accumulation might be required for tumourigenesis, and only IDH1 and IDH2 mutations have these dual effects.",
        "To determine the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, in three groups of Peruvian adults, using fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C).This study included adults from the PERU MIGRANT Study who had fasted ≥ 8 h. Fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL and A1C ≥ 6.5% were used, separately, to define diabetes. Subjects with a current diagnosis of diabetes were excluded. 964 of 988 subjects were included in this analysis. Overall, 0.9% (95%CI 0.3-1.5) and 3.5% (95%CI 2.4-4.7) had diabetes using fasting glucose and A1C criteria, respectively. Compared to those classified as having diabetes using fasting glucose, newly classified subjects with diabetes using A1C (n = 25), were older, poorer, thinner and more likely to come from rural areas. Of these, 40% (10/25) had impaired fasting glucose (IFG).This study shows that the use of A1C as diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus identifies people of different characteristics than fasting glucose. In the PERU MIGRANT population using A1C to define diabetes tripled the prevalence; the increase was more marked among poorer and rural populations. More than half the newly diagnosed people with diabetes using A1C had normal fasting glucose.",
        "Here we describe a toolkit for the production of fluorescently tagged proteins in the C. elegans germline and early embryo using Mos1-mediated single copy insertion (MosSCI) transformation. We have generated promoter and 3'UTR fusions to sequences of different fluorescent proteins yielding constructs for germline expression that are compatible with MosSCI MultiSite Gateway vectors. These vectors allow tagged transgene constructs to be inserted as single copies into known sites in the C. elegans genome using MosSCI. We also show that two C. elegans heat shock promoters (Phsp-16.2 and Phsp-16.41) can be used to induce transgene expression in the germline when inserted via MosSCI transformation. This flexible set of new vectors, available to the research community in a plasmid repository, should facilitate research focused on the C. elegans germline and early embryo.",
        "Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry at carbon fiber microelectrodes allows rapid (sub-second) measurements of dopamine release in behaving animals. Herein, we report the modification of existing technology and demonstrate the feasibility of making sub-second measurements of dopamine release in the caudate nucleus of a human subject during brain surgery. First, we describe the modification of our electrodes that allow for measurements to be made in a human brain. Next, we demonstrate in vitro and in vivo, that our modified electrodes can measure stimulated dopamine release in a rat brain equivalently to previously determined rodent electrodes. Finally, we demonstrate acute measurements of dopamine release in the caudate of a human patient during DBS electrode implantation surgery. The data generated are highly amenable for future work investigating the relationship between dopamine levels and important decision variables in human decision-making tasks.",
        "Humans everywhere cooperate in groups to achieve benefits not attainable by individuals. Individual effort is often not automatically tied to a proportionate share of group benefits. This decoupling allows for free-riding, a strategy that (absent countermeasures) outcompetes cooperation. Empirically and formally, punishment potentially solves the evolutionary puzzle of group cooperation. Nevertheless, standard analyses appear to show that punishment alone is insufficient, because second-order free riders (those who cooperate but do not punish) can be shown to outcompete punishers. Consequently, many have concluded that other processes, such as cultural or genetic group selection, are required. Here, we present a series of agent-based simulations that show that group cooperation sustained by punishment easily evolves by individual selection when you introduce into standard models more biologically plausible assumptions about the social ecology and psychology of ancestral humans. We relax three unrealistic assumptions of past models. First, past models assume all punishers must punish every act of free riding in their group. We instead allow punishment to be probabilistic, meaning punishers can evolve to only punish some free riders some of the time. This drastically lowers the cost of punishment as group size increases. Second, most models unrealistically do not allow punishment to recruit labor; punishment merely reduces the punished agent's fitness. We instead realistically allow punished free riders to cooperate in the future to avoid punishment. Third, past models usually restrict agents to interact in a single group their entire lives. We instead introduce realistic social ecologies in which agents participate in multiple, partially overlapping groups. Because of this, punitive tendencies are more expressed and therefore more exposed to natural selection. These three moves toward greater model realism reveal that punishment and cooperation easily evolve by direct selection--even in sizeable groups.",

Urbanization externalities are measured by the diversity\r\nof industry, which are disaggregated from formal and informal sources, and city size. Results\r\nfrom the paper show that informal household businesses in urban places benefit from clustering\r\nwith formal enterprises but not from informal firms in other industries. Furthermore, the\r\nconcentration in large and dense urban areas does not bring benefits to informal household\r\nbusinesses. The results call for more attention on the urban planning towards the informal\r\nsector in urban places of Vietnam",
        "If it studies the relationship between crude oil price and U.S. dollar, classical literature finds a\r\npositive sign for the correlation of these two variables, i.e. the oil price and the dollar grow up\r\ntogether or they fall together. Instead, researches which use the data of more recent years show\r\na negative link, so that if one variable is rising, the second one is decreasing and vice versa.\r\nBesides, there are two possible directions of causality: the economic theory explains the\r\ninfluence of oil price towards U.S. dollar; while the financial perspective is coherent with the\r\nopposite way. This second thesis is confirmed by the empirical evidence. In this framework, the\r\nfutures and other financial derivatives have changed the picture, modifying how crude oil is\r\npriced and valued by the market.

Our goal is to recognize the structure of political spectacle in BiH political scene and point out the functions and objectives of this relatively new term in the media and the political sphere. In this regard, we have observed a political spectacle as a method of political communication of the rulers to the ruled. A very important element of the political spectacle is the media. With the media promotion of this method of political communication achieves its full capacity. The final outcome of the political spectacle is reflected in manipulating the public. In this way the politicians try to remain in power as long as they can.",
        "Modern revolutions in the Arab world opened up discussions all over the planet, concerning the role of modern information and communication technologies (ICT) in their initiation, conduct, coordination, etc. Certain authors have gone a step further, almost giving the digital technologies a role of demiurge of the new world in which equal interlocutors in all meridians make decisions on the most important segments of their lives, and if a non-democratic government decides to curb the freedom it is enough to go online and start a revolution with a click of the mouse. The aim of this paper is to look at the cause and effect relationships in the ICT - participation - democracy triangle, and thus to try to determine the value and role of new technologies in social processes. The example of 'Arab Spring' is certainly the most popular one, especially since it raises the question whether revolutions would happen at all if there was no Internet, which means that it can serve as a good case study for this paper.",
        "In this paper, the author thoroughly discussed the gnoseological radiation of Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, placing this famous book in the context of epochal and revolutionary topics of this philosopher, from the will for power, overman, through death of God, antipodal tension between the Apollonian and the Dionysian principle of the being, to eternal recurrence of the same. Criticising those anthropological and epistemological interpretations which trivialise the semantic dimension of this jagged and unapproachable work of Nietzsche, the author of the text submits those arguments which illuminate a quite distinctive hermeneutical approach to the nihilistic philosophy of this great German thinker, while at the same time pointing out his 'singing and thinking' for sophisticated understanding of contemporary postmodern situation. Within the globally dominant ideologies, ending with the liberal-democratic and neoliberal, an ontological decision on cultural and personal choice of the masking existence strategy to escape from finitude is founded. Nietzsche's anticipation, according to the author's explanation, reached up to the present moment in which, thanks to the technological, media and information evolution, the autonomous capacity of products originally intended for the total dismissal of the authentic ontological ambience remains such that it becomes active in terms of surveillance of human users. Postmodern reality - observed from the point of view of Nietzsche's insight from the book Thus Spoke Zarathustra - has turned into administrative instance, so far as man has become totally dependent on its maintenance, since he reached the point of leaving himself alone.",
        "The role and importance of the media are huge, both in everyday life and in cultural, spiritual and political life of modern man. Their power in the sense of political shaping of people and shaping of public opinion is very distinctive. In the process of propaganda to influence public opinion, they use various manipulative procedures in order to accomplish certain interests and objectives. Through the media, politics realizes its economic, ideological, political and even military activities. The war in the former Yugoslavia and former Bosnia and Herzegovina was also waged through the media. This media war still is spreading the hate speech, thus still causing conflicts and disintegration processes in the Balkans.",
        "For 100 years there have been debates about the context, causes and culprits for World War I, alongside with constant endeavors to justify German and Austrian state and national reasons for choosing the option of war, and to attribute the biggest part of responsibility to Serbian nationalism. Although the ideals of liberation and unification of South Slavic peoples had many supporters among Croats, Slovenians and Bosniaks, regional historiographies interpret the ideal of Yugoslavia as a Serbian concept, present the Sarajevo assassination in a very negative context and reject it as a symbol of common heritage. At the same time, Serbian historians affirm the belief that unification of South Slavic peoples and creation of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was an act of 'liquidation' of the Serbian state and suppression of Serbian national interest for the sake of common state and an attempt to create a supranational identity which was the cause of future defeats, suffering and ideological wandering. Now, at the 100th anniversary of the beginning of World War I, we again witness shameless attacks on Cyrillic, Vidovdan, Saint Sava, Serbian cultural and religious monuments. Not even in the 21st century does the cultural and political discrimination of Serbs in the region stops, especially in Croatia and Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Because of that, Serbs no longer view Bosnia and Herzegovina as their country, but, as Milorad Ekmečić claims, as a 'leftover of leftovers' of Serbian ethnic community west of river Drina, which was subjected to systematical destruction and genocide during the entire 20th century. Gavrilo Princip and the members of 'Young Bosnia', who did not consider themselves Serbian but 'Serbo-Croatian' and Yugoslavian nationalists, heroic glory carry only in Serbian collective consciousness.",
        "The work treats the real social position of minority religions, denominations, religious communities and churches in postdayton Bosnia and Herzegovina. In other words, the author researches real social, political, legislative, mass-media-communicational, economic status and a status of so called small religious communities and churches in other spheres of existence like education, culture, public health etc., and seeks to answer to, from rhetorical point of view, simple question: are minority religions, denominations, religious communities and churches, as defined and treated by the Law on Freedom of Religion and Legal Position of Churches and Religious Communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, discriminated or not. In the focus of the author's analyses are equally institutional sphere or so called minority religious communities as such, but also and individuals, believers and followers of those institutionalized and formalized religious-denominational- ecclesial subjects having been named religious communities and churches. The results of the author's empirical-theoretical researches can be condensed into nuanced and complex answer whose content leads to conclusion that minority religions, churches and their members in several spheres of life are, after all, in inferior position, in spite of declarative equality of all religions, denominations, religious communities and churches. The author supports such conclusion with numerous and plausible arguments.",
        "The paper approaches the ontological-epistemology aspects of the beauty of Byzantine art. Byzantine aesthetics and Byzantine art are unjustly neglected in the history of aesthetic thought. Christian aestheticians have an ambivalent attitude towards art. Because, Byzantine painting represents reality show based on the Christians view, where absolutizs a new dimension of spirituality and aesthetics deriving from the ontological-epistemological positions. The phenomenon of beauty in Byzantine art is primarily deposited in epistemological components, where everything is directed to the knowledge of the truth. In Byzantine art beauty has, above all, spiritual character; it does not have a classical aesthetic dimension, but primarily because the ontological character is recognized as one of the innumerable divine energies and of phenomena. The Byzantine painter makes an effort to realize the creative transformation of matter into a unique experience community and relationship with God, who volatility of the world beyond the ontological light that is converted from non-being into being.",
        "Following the stages from the establishment itself to the present day of the functioning of such a specific regional organization as the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the article seeks to further explain the meaning of its existence, efficiency and functioning. The CIS was created in order to make the dissolution of a major world super-power, which throughout the 20th century together with the USA defined the bipolar world, as painless as possible, especially for the new countries and its nationally and ethnically diverse population. During the early years after the dissolution of the USSR, the CIS played a major role in a more flexible and less severe dissolution of the Soviet empire, alleviating the consequences for its people. A more efficient functioning among the republics in all fields was also one of the tasks of the Commonwealth, to which it was devoted to the extent which was permitted by the then, not too favourable circumstances. Difficult years of economic crisis did not allow the CIS to mutually integrate its members as much as possible on the economy level. Thanks to the economic recovery of the post-Soviet states in the early 21st century, the Commonwealth has also been transformed, reformed, and renewed, and all this in order to achieve better and more fruitful cooperation between the members. The CIS may serve as a proper example of how the former Soviet Union states are inextricably linked by social, security-political, economic, cultural, communication-transport, and other ties, thanks to the centuries-long existence of the peoples of these states in this area, despite both internal and external factors which occasionally, but temporarily halt the post-Soviet integration. Mathematically expressed, the CIS members are naturally predisposed, to be reciprocally depended on each other, just as they also have the capacity for successful cooperation in the future times and epochs brought on by the modern world.",
        "A liberal democrat is a type of person with whom the masters of the modern world meant to accomplish long time desired freedom and wellfare. If they are sincere, we have to ascertain that their expactations did not fulfill. Ideas of freedom, equality and justice, on whose bases democratic society and state had been built from long time ago, suffered many changes, so today we do not know what they actually mean. They have appeared topics of countless discussions, not once has the world been bathed in blood in the name of them, but have we aproached the goal for a single step? In the name of democracy and human rights, the powerful West creates 'unipolar world' despite the fact that God created it wit at least two sides (with growing-stronger East, and poor South). Diogenes used to search for a 'man' in Athens with a lantern during day, isnt't he an eternal paradigm of hopeless quest? Democracy, apart from its middle level (state) has a basic one - a man, and a higher one, general - cosmopolis, the world community. A community cannot be built on self-will, without political virtue, without a citizen, there is no city (polis - πολις), nor democracy.",

The focus of the study will be on the liberal-communitarian dispute in the theory of citizenship, with main ideas of the most important representatives of liberal discourse in the field of citizenship also being discussed. I will look more closely at the ideas of T.H. Marshall, as the most significant writer of liberal orthodoxy in the second half of the twentieth century, his contribution to liberal theory of passive citizenship, but I will also deal with the ideas of his biggest critics, both from the aspect of liberalism and from the aspect of communitarianism, including Anthony Giddens, Claus Offe, Michael Mann, Barrington Moore and Brian Turner. The emphasis will be on Marshall's term 'conquest of citizenship', as well as on the derivation of various theories of state from the obtained rights achieved through the expansion of the concept of citizenship. Finally, I will say something about modern obstacles to theories of passive citizenship derived from the communitarian school.",
        "The decision of the great powers representatives on the Congress of Berlin to allow Austro-Hungary to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina appeared fatal to survival of a multinational empire, which did not wait long to execute those decisions. Habsburg troupes passed the border on July 29th 1878 at many places, which caused great disturbances in Bosnia and Herzegovina and conflicts with approaching units of black and yellow alliance towards Bosnian and Herzegovinian territory. Serbs were at the edge of the mass rebellion. It is that moment when an embryo of a resistance against occupational government was born, especially among young people, who were not ready to tolerate violence and enslavement in their own country. Immediately after its arrival at the Bosnian and Herzegovinian territory, Austro-Hungary appeared as a real occupational power and thus caused people's revolt, especially of advanced intelligence. Human rights and freedoms were abolished, so it was necessary to form illegal cultural institutions and political organizations. Thus was formed organization of Young Bosnia as well, whose members assasinated Austro-Hungarian prince Franz Ferdinand.",
        "From Boden's understanding of state government as sovereign, i.e. the highest, independent, continuous and indivisible, law, society and the state with its most important quality - the sovereignty of the state government to date have undergone major changes. The sovereignty of the state government and the independence of the state, per se is increasingly more relative phenomenon, from both, the internal and external aspects. The international community as a whole, international law and the will of the stakeholders in the international relations have a growing impact on the internal life of the state, while the state and its authority in the doctrine is attributed with the special qualities such as efficiency, legality, legitimacy, democracy ect.. The political reality is that the doctrine of sovereignty is increasingly associated with the special - exclusive resources and capabilities of certain countries and not to the quality of government, elements of the state, or the will of the people. However, question of state sovereignty is much more than a basic aggregate resource evaluation and simple deregulation, because without a healthy nation-state and its sovereignty internationally recognized system of coordination, or any rightfully supranational order that each state inter se could create, can not exist.",
        "Diplomacy is treated, generally (and wrongly), as just a skill, profession and / or a trade. It is a systematization of what, apparently, happens in practice and, partially, the means and manner of operation of diplomatic activities in theory and practice of international relations. Profound understanding of diplomacy is partly delivered through ethics and activities. However, these ethics are presented in its metaphysical form and, as such, have a unilateral, non-dynamic and non-dialectical Manichaean meaning. For example, peace is something that is good and moral, violence and the like are evil therefor try(ing) to keep the peace is positive, and so on. Things are very different when viewed through the dialectics of history that knows no common morality. The formation and disappearance of nations and civilizations has its roots in terms of history. Violence is often shown as a necessity and is necessity - immoral? Diplomacy, based (metaphorically) on the 'Words', has its roots in the Bible itself and therefore in theory, is a constitutive part of the philosophy of history. In regards to diplomacy, this paper ponder the terms of: the totality, of its Spirit, the Truth, of necessity, freedom, dialectic, postmodernism, neo-liberalism and a hint of the future, historically more humane society.",
        "Referring to the thesis of 'essentially contested concepts' which, according to Walter Gallie, are concepts that, despite their proper use, cause radical and lengthy discussions and unresolvable disagreements among those who use them. In this paper we build the thesis that political communication is essentially a contested concept. To prove this assertion, first we make an overview of different approaches to the concept of 'politics' by showing how the term has changed over time and how it affected the various authors' determinations of definitions. Subsequently, referring to the term of 'communication' and finally to the definition of 'political communication', we demonstrated through the identification of the controversial elements that are commonly used in defining such concepts - that the basic thesis of this paper is true.",

The adolescent population requires more sleep on average than adults but are most likely to be sleep deprived. Adolescence is a time of rapid social upheaval and sensitivity to social stressors including discrimination. This study uses two weeks of daily e-diary measures documenting discrimination exposure and concurrent objective sleep indicators measured using actigraphy.

This novel study shows youth with higher average discrimination reports have worse average sleep relative to their counterparts. Interestingly, youth reporting daily discrimination have better sleep the day of the report than youth who do not.",
        "Considering that customers’ emotions toward received services are evaluated in light of fairness and equity theory, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of customers’ perceptions and emotions of received services on their behavioral intentions. Data were collected from 329 questioners that were distributed among Mellat bank customers, and hypotheses and the conceptual model were analyzed based on the data collected through structural equation modeling in AMOS 18. Results showed that three dimensions of interactional, procedural, and distributive justice affected customers’ emotions (negative and positive) and satisfaction. Customers’ emotions were also found to be having a mediating role in the relationship between perceptions of fairness (except procedural fairness) and customer satisfaction.

        "This study is intended to investigate the impact of brand trust, brand affect, self-image congruity, and functional congruity toward brand loyalty of coffee shop visitors. Participants were approached conveniently in several modern coffee shops in August-September 2014 in southern Jakarta. In total, there are four hypotheses to be tested using 200 usable valid questionnaires. As a result, three hypoth- eses were accepted – the links between brand trust and brand loyalty, self-image congruity and func- tional congruity, and functional congruity and brand loyalty. This study suggests an alternative model in order to have all hypotheses significant and positive. Brand affect and self-image congruity should not be directly linked to brand loyalty concurrently. Coffee shop managements should consider brand trust and functional congruity as two important factors in maintaining brand loyalty.",

        "Objective: The main aim of this article is to present how the heterogeneity of workers, firms, and tasks can be incorporated into empirical international trade analysis. In particular, we provide an empirical example in which we aim to quantify the reliance on foreign value added (FVA) within Global Value Chains (GVC) on wages.\n\nResearch Design & Methods: We estimate a Mincerian wage model augmented with a measure of foreign value added drawn from international input-output data. We employ econometric modeling with instrumental variable (addressing the endogeneity between trade and wages) and estimated through weighted regression with cluster-robust standard errors. \n\nFindings: Controlling for individual workers and job characteristics, we find the negative correlation between FVA and wages. The effect is conditional on the skill and task typology (affecting mostly workers performing routine tasks).\n\nImplications & Recommendations: In empirical international trade analysis it is necessary to capture many dimensions of complexity observed in the real world. We argue that country- level or industry-level analysis on the international trade-wage nexus is not sufficient. \n\nContribution & Value Added: The originality of this work lies in studying wage-international trade interactions in a multicounty setting (which allows for some generality in the conclusions drawn), with the use of microdata which allows us to account for several aspects of heterogeneity. We contribute by providing an example of international trade-labour markets analysis which captures many dimensions of complexity observed in the real world: differences between workers, tasks they perform and firms in which they are employed.",

        "<p><strong>Purpose: </strong>This paper combines a synthetic index system by the variables and evaluates China’s financial safety through the change of indexes in a comprehensive way. First of all, it builds the financial industry evaluation index system composed of 25indicators in terms of the operation of the financial industry and external economic environment and particularly takes into consideration factors which might trigger liquidity risks such as off-balance-sheet business, interbank business and shadow banking; then it selects 10 indicators to conduct empirical analysis and identifies the indicator weight through principal component analysis; finally it combines the financial safety indexes through the linear weighted comprehensive evaluation model.</p><p><strong>Design/methodology/approach: </strong>Synthesis of indexes is made by constructing a proper comprehensive evaluation mathematical model, integrating a number of evaluation indexes into one comprehensive evaluation index and then obtaining corresponding comprehensive evaluation results. In this paper, it selects 10 indexes to conduct empirical analysis and identifies the index weight through principal component analysis; finally it combines the financial safety indexes through the linear weighted comprehensive evaluation model. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. PCA was invented in 1901 and was later independently developed (and named) by Harold Hotelling in the 1930s.</p><p><strong>Findings:</strong> From 2003 to 2013 China’s financial safety indexes fluctuated. From 2003 to 2007 indexes rose, which indicates China’s financial safety status gradually improved; from 2007 to 2009 indexes declined, which indicates due to the impact of subprime crisis, China’s financial safety status took a turn for the worse; from 2009 to 2012 indexes rose, which indicates the external environment improved so did China’s financial safety status; from 2012 to 2013 indexes declined because due to the rapid development of banks’ financial products and trust products, banks’ off-balance-sheet assets and liquidity risks increased. The changes of financial safety indexes are generally identical with those of China’s financial safety status.</p><p><strong>Research limitations/implications:</strong> In the empirical analysis part, this article tries to selective 24 indicators synthetic index of China's financial security, but due to some of the indicators data acquisition is relatively difficult, can only Selective 10 of 25 indicators and gather the annual data of 10 indicators from 2003 to 2013 to synthetic index. The information of eliminated indicators cannot be reflected in the index. Index change also does not reflect of the risk from these indicators. In order to make up for the above limitations, this paper is mainly to introduce and analysis our latest financial institutions business trends associated with these eliminated indicators to get the conclusions more reliable.</p><p><strong>Originality/value: </strong>The aim of this research is to estimate financial safety of China with the application of the index of financial safety of a country using the annual data of 2003-2013. Through synthetic index of financial security measure the risks of China's financial system, provide the basis for the government macro financial policy. The Originality of the paper is mainly manifested in incorporating factors which have made important impacts on China’s financial safety in recent years, but have not been taken into consideration in the existing studies into the newly constructed financial safety index system. For example, some factors that cannot be controlled easily might have huge hidden risk hazards. To be more specific, factors such as off-balance-sheet business, interbank business and shadow banking might trigger liquidity risks. In this way, the research results will be more practical.</p>",

        "There is an assertion that the participation of foreign banks in emerging markets is often thought to improve overall bank soundness. Therefore, if the share of foreign banks in a national banking system is large, the system will quickly overcome both financial or currency crises, and quickly recover itself. Since Turkey has been experienced mentioned crises, the aim of this study is to reveal if the assertion is valid for Turkey. Our expectation from the study using VAR method is to reach a conclusion that countries with large market share of foreign banks have safely passed the crises by virtue of foreign banks best management policies. The test results indicate that foreign banks have more positive effect for helping TBS capital structure; foreign bank participation did not cause any decline in loans and last one, after crisis, existence of foreign banks worsens TBS liquidity in interest and exchange rate shocks.",
        "Decades of research within political science, political communication, and mass media found pervasive gender biased media coverage of female political candidates. However, recent research suggests that gender stereotypes do not have a consistent effect in all campaign environments and when gender stereotypes are not activated, female candidates are not disadvantaged. As a result, if we see a reduction in reliance on gender stereotypes in the media, female candidates should enjoy a more level playing field. In this analysis, we focus on mass media’s coverage of female candidates in elite executive political races. This study conducts a content analysis of media coverage of three recent women candidates for the United States’ highest executive offices: Senator Hillary Clinton, Congresswoman Michelle Bachmann, and Governor Sarah Palin. Our analysis of newspapers and television news coverage confirms the media do not discuss female and male candidates in neutral terms, but instead fall back onto traditional gender stereotypes and emphasize female candidates’ physical appearances and family roles far more frequently than they do for male candidates. This may, in turn, prime gender stereotypes in voters, impair candidates’ fundraising ability, and limit the electoral ambition of future generations of female candidates.",

Chemists must be acquainted with the principles of green chemistry and the need to practice experimental chemistry with cleaner chemical reactions and sustainability. This is a major concern for all the educators forming new professionals within the Chemistry, Pharmacology and Biology curricula in the Faculty for Higher Studies Zaragoza from the National Autonomous University of Mexico. With this in mind, we start our teachings explaining from the very beginning, how important it is to perform microscale techniques and to follow the principles of green chemistry in the Basic Science Laboratory. Furthermore, we have modified, designed and evaluated working procedures related with chemical synthesis, kinetics and calorimetry. By doing this, we managed to greatly reduce the amount of reagents required and residues generated. Some laboratory reagents have been substituted with renewable substances. We have also included in our programme a regular treatment of residues generated during everyday laboratory work.

        "We study the evolution of strategic psychological capabilities in a population of interacting agents. Specifically, we consider agents which are either blind or with mindsight, and either transparent or opaque. An agent with mindsight can observe the psychological makeup of a transparent agent, i.e., its logic, emotions, commitments and other elements that determine how it chooses actions. A blind agent cannot observe and opaque agents cannot be observed. Our assumption that mindsight and transparency are costly and optional exposes a middle ground between standard game theory without mindsight and evolution of preferences theory with obligatory and costless mindsight. We show that the only evolutionarily stable monomorphic population is one in which all agents are blind, opaque, and act-rational. We find that mindsight, transparency, and rule-rational commitments may evolve, albeit only in a portion of the population that fluctuates in size over generations. We reexamine the Ultimatum and Trust games in light of our findings and demonstrate that an evolved population of agents can differ significantly from a population of simplistic payoff-maximizers in terms of psychological traits and economic outcomes.",
        "<p>The most popular American writer the year the Civil War began was not, perhaps, American. A nation on the verge of splitting asunder enthusiastically consumed stories of its national identity being consolidated in Africa in a book by Paul Belloni du Chaillu, a young man of ambiguous origins and spectacular credibility issues. His 1861 bestseller Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa about his pith-helmeted exploits marked him as an intrepid scientist or armchair fantasist or, possibly, both. Regardless, his rise from anonymity to transatlantic sensation in a moment of acute national crisis suggests that something important was created and perceived in the shifting identitarian signs of his person and his work. Du Chaillu was not simply a European adventurer or American journalist or African homesteader, all of which he became, for capital of all sorts moved through him in multinational and continental forms. As a result, Du Chaillu deserves a space of prominence in any configuration of a nineteenth-century transatlantic canon. He also merits attention as the author of the last great antebellum American narrative. The fact that the qualifier “American” in that statement is utterly debatable is entirely, given 1861, the point.</p>",

The assessment uses 42 energy security indicators, which can be separated into five components: overall energy balance, socio-economic aspect, domestic energy resources, overseas energy demands and resources, and diversification of energy supply. The findings show different energy security situations among ASEAN member nations that are a result of national energy contexts, specifically uneven economic and energy infrastructure developments. The context, at a national level, affects the connotation of energy security and the interpretation of the indicators, which reflects different primary issues of concern regarding energy security. At the international level, due to the diversity, the interconnection of intra-regional energy markets could contribute to energy self-reliance of the region. Adversely, the difference could hinder the prospect of cooperation due to the lack of consensus on shared value.",

        "Abstract—Given the vast coverage area and dispersed population centres in which nursing professionals practice in Australia, Remote Access Laboratory (RAL) based learning activities would seem to be an ideal match. However while they are commonplace in engineering faculties; in other disciplines such activities are not widely used. This may well be due to the intricacies of these practicals not being as straightforward and readily reproducible as typical physics or science experiments. In our chosen case, the safe practice of intravenous pump driver operations and related clinical reasoning skills are important components for the training of both registered nurses and nursing students. The aim of this research project is to develop and trial remote access technologies that enable nursing students to test their knowledge, skills, and clinical reasoning with intravenous infusion pump drivers. This has been possible by extending the concept of RAL from a physical and tangible experiment, to more conceptual experimentation in any form conducted remotely. In such a context clinical reasoning becomes possible. This paper discusses a prototype system that has been built with collaborative input from the Faculty of Engineering and Surveying and the Department of Nursing and Midwifery. An initial evaluation with a group of nursing students has been completed to assess if such activities can assist with the training of student nurses. Previous work has identified the need to scaffold learning activities that rely on RAL technology; the key conclusion in this paper is that in the context of nursing this has to be taken a step further. RAL activities here require contextualisation to become an effective learning tool.",

        "Most of human-machine interfaces (HMIs) for process control disseminated in the industry are mostly technique-oriented and don't reflect operators' needs. This approach tries to compensate this lack through offering user-oriented interfaces characterized as cognitive-compatible. If HMIs have to be cognitive-compatible, then designers should take various cognitive objects such as reasoning, memory and knowledge into account. The ecological interface design (EID) offers a well-founded methodology for designing HMIs because, on the one hand, the internal physical behavior of the technical system will be exposed through the interface; and, on the other, a harmonic and an effective interaction between operators and machines will be achieved. This kind of interaction is to see as the positive result of utilizing the physical and functional characteristics of the technical system as design inputs. Additionally, EID is oriented to the three human behavior levels: the skill-, rule- and knowledge-based levels known as the human-information processing. In order to obtain cognitive-compatible HMIs constructed of EID objects, a suitable means like the object-oriented programming (OOP) in combination with a powerful development tool such as the Visual Studio .NET Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is needed. As OOP is based on nouns and reflects how the real world is perceived, it disburdens developers in translating their design ideas and models into computer applications.",

The proposed solution combines a test language command interpreter and various virtual instruments (VIs), with a demonstration board that comprises a boundary-scan IEEE 1149.1 / 1149.4 test infrastructure. The experiments are presented as embedded learning objects, with no distinction from other e-learning contents (e.g. lessons, lecture notes, etc.).",
        "Statement of problem: Secondary dental caries is a common clinical finding in composite restoration. The development of a bactericidal dental adhesive provides a promising method to reduce the risk of secondary caries.  \r\nObjectives: This study aimed to assess the antibacterial activity of silver (Ag) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles incorporated into an experimental dentin bonding agent formulation.\r\nMaterials and Methods: Ag and TiO2 nanoparticles at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 wt% concentrations were incorporated into the adhesives. The suspensions were sonicated to ensure homogenous dispersion of nanoparticles in the adhesive system. Formulation was composed of acetone, 2,2-bis[4-(2-hydroxy-3-methacryloxypropoxy)phenyl]propane (Bis-GMA), 1,6-bis-[2-methacryloyloxyethyl carbonyl amino]-2,4,4-trimethylhexane (UDMA), trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (TMPTMA), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), and photoinitiator, with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as the stabilizer. We counted the colony-forming units (CFU%) of two cariogenic bacteria, Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus), that were exposed to the powdered light cured adhesive specimens. The effects of various concentrations of each nanoparticle were compared by one-way ANOVA, followed by the post hoc Bonferroni test. \r\nResults: All samples exhibited definite antibacterial activity (P<0.05) compared to the control specimens. The Ag nanoparticle samples showed higher antibacterial properties compared to the TiO2 nanoparticle samples. Increasing the concentration of nanoparticles resulted in significant differences in bactericidal properties, with the exception of 0.2 to 0.5 wt% Ag nanoparticle specimens exposed to S. mutans and the 0.2 to 0.5 wt% TiO2 nanoparticle specimens exposed to L. acidophilus.\r\nConclusions: These metal-based nanoparticles exhibited dose-dependent bactericidal activities. The Ag nanoparticles had higher antibacterial activity compared to the TiO2 nanoparticles. Incorporation of these nanoparticles into dental adhesives is a promising way to reduce the risk of secondary caries. However, further clinical evaluations should be performed.\r\n",
        "In 2002 the Medical University of Graz (MUG) introduced its first Learning Management System (LMS). One of the first applications developed was a virtual microscope 1.0 (VM 1.0) to be used by students via a standard web browser. The basic idea was to offer the functionality of a microscope via an interactive application which is integrated within the LMS. The main advantages of that concept were saving costs, enhancing the flexibility for students and utilizing additional features and possibilities offered by new media. Cost saving was achieved by replacing hundreds of expensive physical microscopes by the virtual microscope, which can be used on any PC with a standard web browser. After more than 8 years the technology as well as the functionality of the VM 1.0 was now out-dated. We describe the stages to introduce a VM 2.0 within VMC/Moodle in order to help other universities who want to introduce a VM for their students to speed up the decision process and to avoid possible traps.",

When the number of students in the experiment exceeds the number of devices, then the experiment is carried out by some of the students only while the rest remains indifferent to the experiment. Therefore, not all the students can benefit from the experiment. Nowadays remote laboratory and its applications are being very popular by young scientists and undergraduate students who are willing to learn and research in different topics of their interests.

        "A PEA (Pulse Equivalent Area) approach for orientation control of an under actuated pointing device is proposed. The presented work is a sequel to the earlier work done by the authors for the orientation control of the drill machine. The desired orientation is realized through control pulses during specific roll instants. These pulses are generated through single pair of electromagnets mounted on the housing of the pointing device. Due to practical limitation of the system, there is an additional constraint on the actuating signal. The amplitude of the actuating signal is fixed and the Pulse width or duration of the pulse can vary. A discrete equivalent model of pointing device is also developed. A novel approach based on PEA is developed since the exact solution of discrete equivalent model under constraints was not possible. The simulations are included to compare proposed technique with the existing technique developed for similar systems. The performance is also shown under both nominal and parameter variations through Monte Carlo simulations",

        "Compressive strength is greatly influenced by the performance of concrete in its fresh stage such as uniform mixing, proper compaction, resistance to segregation during transporting and placing. Attempt has, therefore, been made to correlate compressive strength to the rheological behavior of high performance concrete with a modified setup of parallel plate rheometer. Modified setup considers the shearing of concrete at the centre of the cylindrical container that takes into account the resistance between concrete and the vertical side of the wall. It has been observed that compressive strength increases steeply as the yield strength increases up to a certain level. Plastic viscosity, however, shows optimum value for maximum compressive strength.",
        "<p>Soybean seeds contain large amounts of isoflavones or phytoestrogens such as genistein, daidzein, and glycitein that display biological effects when ingested by humans and animals. In seeds, the total amount, and amount of each type, of isoflavone varies by 5 fold between cultivars and locations. Isoflavone content and quality are one key to the biological effects of soy foods, dietary supplements, and nutraceuticals. Previously we had identified 6 loci (QTL) controlling isoflavone content using 150 DNA markers. This study aimed to identify and delimit loci underlying heritable variation in isoflavone content with additional DNA markers. We used a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population (<math alttext=\"$n=100$\">  <mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>100</mn> </math>) derived from the cross of &#8220;Essex&#8221; by &#8220;Forrest,&#8221; two cultivars that contrast for isoflavone content. Seed isoflavone content of each RIL was determined by HPLC and compared against 240 polymorphic microsatellite markers by one-way analysis of variance. Two QTL that underlie seed isoflavone content were newly discovered. The additional markers confirmed and refined the positions of the six QTL already reported. The first new region anchored by the marker BARC-Satt063 was significantly associated with genistein (<math alttext=\"$P=0.009$\">  <mi>P</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.009</mn> </math>, <math alttext=\"$R^2=29.5\\%$\">  <msup>  <mi>R</mi>  <mn>2</mn>  </msup>  <mo>=</mo><mn>29.5</mn><mo>%</mo> </math>) and daidzein (<math alttext=\"$P=0.007$\">  <mi>P</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.007</mn> </math>, <math alttext=\"$R^2=17.0\\%$\">  <msup>  <mi>R</mi>  <mn>2</mn>  </msup>  <mo>=</mo><mn>17.0</mn><mo>%</mo> </math>). The region is located on linkage group B2 and derived the beneficial allele from Essex. The second new region defined by the marker BARC-Satt129 was significantly associated with total glycitein (<math alttext=\"$P=0.0005$\">  <mi>P</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.0005</mn> </math>, <math alttext=\"$R^2=32.0\\%$\">  <msup>  <mi>R</mi>  <mn>2</mn>  </msup>  <mo>=</mo><mn>32.0</mn><mo>%</mo> </math>). The region is located on linkage group D1a+Q and also derived the beneficial allele from Essex. Jointly the eight loci can explain the heritable variation in isoflavone content. The loci may be used to stabilize seed isoflavone content by selection and to isolate the underlying genes.</p>",

        "Utilization of hydro-power as renewable energy source is of prime importance in the world now. Hydropower energy is available in abundant in form of falls, canals rivers, dams etc. It means, there are various types of sites with different parameters like flow rate, heads, etc. Depending upon the sites, water turbines are designed and manufactured to avail hydro-power energy. Low head turbines on runof-river are widely used for the purpose. Low head turbines are classified as reaction turbines. For runof river, depending upon the variety of site data, low head Kaplan turbines are selected, designed and manufactured. For any given site requirement, it becomes very essential to design the turbine runner blades through optimization of the CAD model of blades profile. This paper presents the optimization technique carried out on a complex geometry of blade profile through static and dynamic computational analysis. It is used through change of the blade profile geometry at five different angles in the 3D (Three Dimensional) CAD model. Blade complex geometry and design have been developed by using the coordinates point system on the blade in PRO-E /CREO software. Five different blade models are developed for analysis purpose. Based on the flow rate and heads, blade profiles are analyzed using ANSYS software to check and compare the output results for optimization of the blades for improved results which show that by changing blade profile angle and its geometry, different blade sizes and geometry can be optimized using the computational techniques with changes in CAD models.",
        "Wastewater characterization is an integral part of treatment and management strategies for industrial effluents. This paper outlines the results of detailed wastewater characterization studies conducted for a textile mill in Lahore, Punjab. The results of this study demonstrated that the composition of textile wastewater could change continuously due to inherent nature of textile operations. In general, textile wastewater was high in temperature and alkaline in nature. It was highly polluted in terms of solids and organic content. Most of the portion of solids and organic load was in the soluble form. On the basis of mean values, temperature, pH, TDS (Total Dissolved Solids), BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) were above the limits set by NEQS (National Environmental Quality Standards) while chlorides and sulfates were below the limits set by NEQS. Prior neutralization of wastewater with an acid and addition of phosphorus and nitrogen is imperative for its effective treatment.",
        "Under the condition of elastic-plastic deformation, aero engine casings experience local stress and\r\nstrain concentrations along with associated variations in load paths and stiffness. The accurate prediction\r\nof such behaviour is clearly necessary for design optimisation, potentially leading to beneficial weight\r\nsavings. The present research seeks to tackle the objective of accurate characterisation of elasticplastic\r\ncasing behaviour. The objective is to develop approximate techniques for predicting the elasticplastic\r\nbehaviour, for both generalised load-displacement responses (i.e. for global response) and notch\r\nstress-strain responses. Accurate prediction of the stress-strain distribution at a notch is difficult and\r\nexisting notch prediction techniques can only be used for small strains. This paper seeks to develop novel\r\ntechniques for predicting large elastic-plastic notch strain and associated stresses, with application to\r\naero engine casing notches. The repeated local joints at the spoke-shell casing are of particular interest\r\nas they are the most likely sites for plastic deformation and possibly crack initiation. These local joints\r\nincorporate realistic notch-type features and the load cases cover a range of loading combinations, to\r\ndevelop insight and understanding of the elastic-plastic behaviour. This work analyse a double edgenotched\r\nflat bar with semicircular notches and a representative case of actual aero engine casing-type\r\nstructures in a more simplified form. The investigation was carried out for structures for which stress\r\nand total strain are related by a power law. The equivalent stress at a notch can be estimated, given the\r\nvalue of n, by a linear interpolation between the stresses for a cases n=1 and n=0. The application of the\r\nnotch stress-strain prediction method is illustrated through use of examples of notch components. The\r\npredictions are compared with results obtained using finite element analyses and approximate methods\r\nproposed by Nueber and Glinka.",
        "The II-VI polycrystalline semiconducting materials have come under increased scrutiny because of their wide use in the cost reduction of devices for photovoltaic applications. Cd1Ã¢ÂˆÂ’XZnXTe is one of the II-VI ternary semiconductor materials whose bandgap can be tailored to any value between 1.48Ã¢Â€Â“2.26Ã¢Â€Â‰eV as X varies from 0 to 1. It is promising material for high-efficiency solar cells, switching, and other optoelectronic devices. Polycrystalline thin film of Cd1Ã¢ÂˆÂ’XZnXTe with variable composition  (0Ã¢Â‰Â¤XÃ¢Â‰Â¤1) has been deposited on ultraclean glass substrates by screen printing method followed by sintering process. The optical and structural properties of Cd1Ã¢ÂˆÂ’XZnXTe thin films have been examined. The optical bandgap of these films is studied using reflection spectra in wavelength range of  350Ã¢Â€Â“900Ã¢Â€Â‰nm by using double beam spectrophotometer. The structure of sample was determined from X-ray diffraction patterns. The films were polycrystalline in nature having wurtzite (Hexagonal) structure over the whole range studied. The lattice parameters vary almost linearly with the composition parameter X, following Vegard's law. Sintering is a very simple and viable method compared to other cost-intensive methods. The results of the present investigation will be useful in characterizing the material CdZnTe for its applications in photovoltaics.",
        "<p>Discovery of &#8220;signature&#8221; protein profiles that distinguish disease states (eg, malignant, benign, and normal) is a key step towards translating recent advancements in proteomic technologies into clinical utilities.

Making sense out of such high-dimensional complex data is challenging and necessitates the use of a systematic data analytic strategy. We propose here a data processing strategy for two major issues in the analysis of such mass-spectrometry-generated proteomic data: (1) separation of protein &#8220;signals&#8221; from background &#8220;noise&#8221; in protein intensity measurements and (2) calibration of protein mass/charge measurements across samples.

        "Fabric Porosity is an important property in determining the functional properties of a fabric. It relates to the count of a yarn as well as to the type of weave. Twill and satin cotton woven fabrics in three different weft densities (warp density kept constant) were used to investigate the effect of porosity on the dyeuptake within one weave. The effects of change in weave type, keeping yarn densities the same, on the porosity were also investigated. Objective determination of porosity was carried out using an image analysis technique while, colour yield was determined using K/S values. Higher the weft density in a satin fabric low will be the porosity of that fabric. Porosity values varied from 6.85-10.98% for S1 and S3 respectively. However, for the twill fabric no substantial change in porosity have been observed as the porosity values varied from 6.4-5.3% for T1 and T3 respectively. Colour strengths for S1 and T1 are lower than S3 and T3 respectively for all the primary colours at 0.25, 1.00 and 2.00% depth levels. It is observed that the change in colour strength is more prominent at 2% depth level as compared to 0.25% depth level",
        "The globalization and saturated domestic markets force international firms to gradually expand their businesses across the borders to capture potential emerging markets. The decision to select a country for a new cement plant location demands analysis of a large number of factors. It is a multifaceted problem which requires investigation and prioritization of factors in a hierarchical way.This paper uses an FAHP (Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process) based procedure proposing a practical framework for solution of the GCPLP (Global Cement Plant Location Problem). It deals with real world ambiguities and handles a broader spectrum of influencing factors. The criteria for selection of a country for a new cement plant installation are prioritized from the FAHP based evaluation made by experts. Different global databases including the World Bank are used for the fuzzy ratings of the alternatives. It has been learnt in this particular problem that cement specific and cost related factors are the most sensitive while legal regulations and economic conditions are relatively less sensitive for the decision makers. Therefore, the countries having strong lime stone reserves, cheaper fuel costs and good internal marketing positions are higher in ranking. The paper concludes with different rankings of the four countries analyzed which assist the strategic managers in making decisions on the basis of mathematically computed results.",
        "Lahore is a fast-growing metropolis experiencing rapid growth in people and vehicle population. This\r\nunprecedented growth has led to urban sprawl, dependency on motorized transport, and increased\r\nparking space demands throughout the city limits. Off-street parking supply is insufficient and the\r\ndemand is met mainly by roadside parking with and without any authorization. Parking on the roads and\r\nsidewalks has resulted in reduction in traffic capacity, traffic speed variation, accidents and disruption\r\nin smooth flow of traffic. Though the government has adopted measures in the past to streamline\r\nroadside parking activities, these efforts have proved counter-productive.

This paper takes the opportunity to investigate fundamental factors that give rise to safety issues in local construction industry. A set of 23 factors have been identified based on the literature review. A questionnaire survey is then conducted that has reflected the most significant factors inflicting upon the safety issues on construction sites. The analysis results of 49 questionnaire survey responses showed that most significant factors causing health and safety hazards in construction projects are poor safety awareness among firm?s leadership, lack of technical guidance in performing construction operations, lack of technological innovation/ use to improve safety, lack of strictly defined operational procedures and poor safety awareness of project managers",
        "A novel beamforming algorithm based on conjugate gradient methods is described and\r\nits performance is computed in terms of bit error rate for practical CDMA 2000\r\ncommunication systems. The proposed technique attempts to maximize signal-to-noise\r\nplus interference of the received signal, and is based on solving the eigenvalue problem\r\nwhere the optimization of the weight vector is done using the pilot channel. The\r\nperformance is simulated for practical CDMA 2000 1X communications systems in\r\nwireless propagation environments with high angle spread. The performance of the\r\nproposed beamforming algorithm is also compared with existing beamforming\r\nalgorithms. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm\r\nis more robust to higher angle spread.",
        "Many encoding schemes are used in OCDMA (Optical Code Division Multiple Access Network) but SAC (Spectral Amplitude Codes) is widely used. It is considered an effective arrangement to eliminate dominant noise called MAI (Multi Access Interference). Various codes are studied for evaluation with respect to their performance against three noises namely shot noise, thermal noise and PIIN (Phase Induced Intensity Noise). Various Mathematical models for SNR (Signal to Noise Ratios) and BER (Bit Error Rates) are discussed where the SNRs are calculated and BERs are computed using Gaussian distribution assumption. After analyzing the results mathematically, it is concluded that ZCC (Zero Cross Correlation Code) performs better than the other selected SAC codes and can serve larger number of active users than the other codes do. At various receiver power levels, analysis points out that RDC (Random Diagonal Code) also performs better than the other codes. For the power interval between -10 and -20 dBm performance of RDC is better ZCC. Their lowest BER values suggest that these codes should be part of an efficient and cost effective OCDM access network in the future.",
        "EPs (Extracting Frequent Patterns) from the continuous transactional data streams is a challenging and\r\ncritical task in some of the applications, such as web mining, data analysis and retail market, prediction\r\nand network monitoring, or analysis of stock market exchange data. Many algorithms have been developed\r\npreviously for mining FPs (Frequent Patterns) from a data stream. Such algorithms are currently highly\r\nrequired to develop new solutions and approaches to the precise handling of data streams. New techniques,\r\nsolutions, or approaches are developed to address unbounded, ordered, and continuous sequences of data\r\nand for the generation of data at a rapid speed from data streams. Hence, extracting FPs using fresh or\r\nrecent data involves the high-level analysis of data streams. We have suggested an efficient technique for\r\nthe window sliding model; this technique extracts new and fresh FPs from high-speed data streams. In\r\nthis study, a CPILT (Compacted Tree Compact Pattern Tree) is developed to capture the latest contents in\r\nthe stream and to efficiently remove outdated contents from the data stream. The main concept introduced\r\nin this work on CPILT is the dynamic restructuring of a tree, which is helpful in producing a compacted\r\ntree and the frequency descending structure of a tree on runtime. With the help of the mining technique\r\nof FP growth, a complete list of new and fresh FPs is obtained from a CPILT using an existing window. The\r\nmemory usage and time complexity of the latest FPs in high-speed data streams can",

The proposed technique is based on two phases: in first phase it removes the class imbalance problem and in the next, it applies DBN followed by FFNN (Feed-Forward Neural Network) to build a prediction model. The obtained results are compared with those given in [9]. The prediction accuracy of our model shows promising results on both intrusion and normal patterns",
        "The growing popularity of RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) systems cannot be overlooked due to\r\ntheir wide range of application areas. However, some RFID applications face security and privacy threats\r\ndue to the exposure of tags over wider distances. There are security methods but these can lack security\r\nand scalability when authenticating RF tags in MORIS (Multi Organizational RFID System). RFID\r\nsystems operating within a single domain have only security and privacy issues due to the security\r\nmethod on tags, but in a multi-organizational system there are even more security and privacy issues in\r\nthe system architecture rather than just in the security method on tag side. In this paper, we have\r\ndesigned a broker service to EPC (Electronic Product Code) system architecture for secure and confidential\r\ndata management of the RFID data events. Secure and confidential authentication broker service is an\r\nextension to the EPC network architecture for a MORIS. The central authentication broker service\r\nensures to avoid illicit access to the confidential RFID tag\\'s data such as EPC code, whilst managing a\r\nlarge-scale authentication data to ensure secure and deterministic response to the authentic entities of\r\nthe system.",

        "Amino-functional silicone softeners are most widely used type of soft finishes owing to their outstanding permanent softness, smoothness and handle characteristics. These soft finishes are prepared in different emulsion droplet sizes such as macro and micro emulsions providing varying characteristics on the textile on which they are applied. The macroemulsions due to their larger droplet sizes lubricate fabric and yarn surfaces, while the micro-emulsion, thanks to their smaller sizes penetrate inside fiber pores. In this research amino-functional macro and micro emulsions have been applied on dyed cotton fabric in 1:1 combination and compared against their influence on physical properties such as bending length, abrasion resistance, tensile strength, crease resistance and water repellency. These emulsions have also been compared for their influence on colorimetric properties; color difference and color strength (K/S values). The results reveal that the softener`s application in combination improves the properties deteriorated by each softener when applied separately",
        "Granular materials are found every where despite they are poorly understood at\r\nmicroscopic level. The main hindrance is how to connect the microscopic properties\r\nwith the macroscopic behavior and propose a rigorous unified theory. One method is to\r\ntest the existing theoretical models in various configurations. In this connection we\r\nhave performed experiments in different configurations of granules in a silo to\r\ndetermine the validity of the Janssen model under such arrangements. Two and four\r\nlayered structures of different bead diameters are prepared. The effective mass at the\r\nbottom of the container in such cases have been measured. Moreover, the investigation\r\nof layered structures reveals that such configurations also follow well the Janssen\r\nmodel. An interesting percolation phenomenon was observed when smaller beads were\r\nstacked on larger ones, despite the model remained valid. Furthermore, it is\r\ndemonstrated that Janssen law holds for larger bead diameters.",
        "Polyester fabric is generally dyed using high temperature dyeing technique and carrier. Both techniques require high energy consumption while few carriers are toxic in nature. In this study, 100% polyester woven fabric was dyed by microwave and conventional dyeing technique with disperse dye; Foron Blue RD GLN by an exhaust method for short dyeing cycle (15 and 30 min). The fabric samples were dyed using conventional high temperature dyeing technique using recommended recipe. Moreover, samples were also dyed using microwave technique with recommended recipe and by the addition of salt and urea, pre-treatment with caustic and organic solvent for improving the dye uptake value and fastness properties. The dyeing assessment; (K/S)?max value by Datacolor spectrophotometer, dye uniformity by optical microscope and washing fastness by grey scale were measured. It has been observed that over conventional dyeing method, microwave irradiation dyed sample gives almost 70% high (K/S)?max value and uniform dye penetration and good to very good washing fastness property. In addition, microwave dyeing gives excellent dyeing behavior at short dyeing cycle; 15 min; hence saves energy and sustainable dyeing process",
        " Modernization and Globalization have made the multimedia technology as one of the fastest growing field in recent times but optimal use of bandwidth and storage has been one of the topics which attract the research community to work on. Considering that images have a lion?s share in multimedia communication, efficient image compression technique has become the basic need for optimal use of bandwidth and space. This paper proposes a novel method for image compression based on fusion of moving average histogram and RBF (Radial Basis Function). Proposed technique employs the concept of reducing color intensity levels using moving average histogram technique followed by the correction of color intensity levels using RBF networks at reconstruction phase. Existing methods have used low resolution images for the testing purpose but the proposed method has been tested on various image resolutions to have a clear assessment of the said technique. The proposed method have been tested on 35 images with varying resolution and have been compared with the existing algorithms in terms of CR (Compression Ratio), MSE (Mean Square Error), PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio), computational complexity. The outcome shows that the proposed methodology is a better trade off technique in terms of compression ratio, PSNR which determines the quality of the image and computational complexity",

        "Spur dikes are used for river protection purposes. They are typical in-stream structures. There existence results in a considerable change in the flow structure of open channel flow both upstream and downstream of the spur dike. This paper presents a numerical work conducted to get the mean and turbulent flow features under the influence of spur dike. Primary velocity distributions over cross sections and horizontal planes, streamlines over vertical sections and turbulence kinetic energy were investigated. The presence of spur dike was found to have disturbed all the investigated flow features along the length of the channel. The flow separation and recirculation was observed on the down stream side of the dike. The reversal of flow behind the dike was directed downwards from the surface. On the basis of the results obtained in this study, an attempt has been made to enhance the understanding of the flow patterns which exist in case of a spur dike which can further be used for development and improvement of formulae relevant to spur-dikes.",
        "The current study compares consumer behavior and Cultural Orientations between engineering and non-engineering students in Pakistan. Engineering students by virtue of their academic background are considered to have more technical know-how, more cognitive skills and can easily learn and adopt a new technology as compared to students from a non-engineering background. Furthermore the researchers were interested to find out that how the thinking skills and choice making of engineering students differ\r\nfrom other students and ultimately effects their consumer behavior and Cultural Dimensions. For this purpose three consumer behavior variables have been selected that are Customer Satisfaction, Customer\r\nLoyalty and Customer Switching. Cultural Dimensions are measured using the model proposed by Geert Hofstede. Two technologically sophisticated services are used in this study that is Mobile Phone and\r\nDebit Cards. The target population of the study consisted of 5000 students of which approximately 500 respondents were from various engineering universities in Pakistan. The comparison of consumer behavior and Cultural Dimensions differences was made through two group?s Discriminant Analysis.\r\nDifferences in behavior and Cultural Dimensions have been reported among the engineering versus non-engineering students. Mobile Phone services satisfaction and loyalty were high among nonengineering\r\nstudents whereas engineering student?s registered higher satisfaction and loyalty in Debit Card services.

        "Extraction of maximum power from PV (Photovoltaic) cell is necessary to make the PV system efficient. Maximum power can be achieved by operating the system at MPP (Maximum Power Point) (taking the operating point of PV panel to MPP) and for this purpose MPPT (Maximum Power Point Trackers) are used. There are many tracking algorithms/methods used by these trackers which includes incremental conductance, constant voltage method, constant current method, short circuit current method, PAO (Perturb and Observe) method, and open circuit voltage method but PAO is the mostly used algorithm because it is simple and easy to implement. PAO algorithm has some drawbacks, one is low tracking speed under rapid changing weather conditions and second is oscillations of PV systems operating point around MPP. Little improvement is achieved in past papers regarding these issues. In this paper, a new method named ?Decrease and Fix? method is successfully introduced as improvement in PAO algorithm to overcome these issues of tracking speed and oscillations. Decrease and fix method is the first successful attempt with PAO algorithm for stability achievement and speeding up of tracking process in photovoltaic system. Complete standalone photovoltaic system?s model with improved perturb and observe algorithm is simulated in MATLAB Simulink",
        "This paper investigated the impact of velocity variation in wide streets. The building\r\nAR (Aspect Ratio) (Street-canyon-width-to-building-height i.e. W/H) has been calculated\r\nby varying the width of street canyon. The k-? turbulence model was applied to ideal\r\nstreet canyons of aspect ratio 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 while the wind speed was varied from 0.5\r\nto 4.0 m/s. The street canyon aspect ratio 1.0 was obtained by increasing the width of\r\nthe street two times (i.e. W=1) as much as for AR0.5 (i.e. W=0.5). However, different\r\nresults obtained from AR1 were compared with AR0.5 to analyze the impact of wide\r\nstreets. Results show that the temperatures reduce with an increase in ambient wind\r\nspeed. However, the impact of ambient wind speed was comparatively higher in narrow\r\nstreet canyons since temperature reduced by over 1.4 K with an increase of 3.5 m/s in\r\nambient wind speed. On the other hand, in the case of AR1.0 the area weighted average\r\ntemperature reduced by 1.3 K with an increase of 3.5 m/s in ambient wind speed. It is\r\nfound that removing heat from narrower street canyons is comparatively difficult.\r\nResults show that the temperatures within the target street canyon of AR0.5 with\r\nambient wind speed of 0.5 m/s were around 0.71 K higher than that in AR1.",

This paper aims at comparing texture features based on Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) with ones based on Gabor wavelets for unsupervised image segmentation. The comparison is realized theoretically, analytically, as well as empirically. Images of natural scenes from a standard image database have been taken as test images. Analytical comparison shows that the DFT-based features are computationally less expensive than those based on Gabor wavelets. Empirical results show that the performance of the texture features based on DFT is comparable to those based on Gabor wavelets.",
        "VSC (Voltage Source Converter) feed-forward control strategy of DVR (Dynamic Voltage Restorer) for\r\nan in-phase voltage injection scheme is proposed in this paper to tackle not only voltage sags and swells\r\nin the utility supply but also phase jumps as well. The proposed strategy utilizes a time based ramp at a\r\nclock rate of 50Hz to obtain a 3-phase reference signal that is compared with actual 3-phase utility\r\nvoltage to obtain an error signal. If the error in each phase of the utility voltage is greater than zero then\r\nappropriate control signals are generated. The switching devices in VSC are switched accordingly to\r\ncompensate voltage sags, swells and phase jumps in the utility voltage that propagates to load. For the\r\nmitigation of voltage sags, swells and phase jumps, the unipolar SPWM control is used.\r\nThe proposed control system response time to compensate voltage sag, swell and phase jump through\r\nswitching of VSC devices is less than 10ms whereas ITIC curve and SEMI-F-47 standard suggest a\r\ntarget of 20ms. Load voltage THD is below 5% as per IEEE Std. 519-1992.\r\nThese results show that employed control strategy has an excellent capability of voltage restoration with\r\nacceptable harmonic distortion, within specified time frame for smooth and clean power flow to load.\r\nMATLAB/Simulink SimpowerSystem tool box has been used to obtain simulation results to verify\r\nthe effectiveness and validity of the proposed control strategy to improve the quality of the power delivered\r\nto the load.",

This phenomenon is especially significant in public sector where most of the projects complete\r\nbeyond their target dates. Though there are numerous factors that cause time slippage, the emphasis of\r\nthis study is to identify those for which the owners are responsible. Lack of knowledge and poor\r\nappreciation of proper planning for different phases of construction projects and its impact on cost and\r\ntime is a dilemma for owners. This research is based upon three case studies of public sector projects\r\nand aims to identify different factors that cause delays in public sector construction projects in order to\r\nhelp different stakeholders find the causes of delays due to the owners’ action or inaction.\r\nThis research also looks into cost overruns resulting from delays, with the aim at educate the owners\r\nabout their responsibilities towards different phases of construction projects and devise measures to\r\nmitigate different types of claims, which may arise because of these delays. The most common delay\r\nfactors, such as, inadequate design details at the start of the project; major changes in design; late\r\nissuance of construction drawings; inadequate funding and delay in issuance of NOC’s/approvals\r\nassociated with government agencies, have been identified to help owners in planning the projects in an\r\nefficient and effective manner.

        "Statistical modeling imparts significant role in predicting the impact of potential factors affecting the one step fixation process of reactive printing and easy care finishing. Investigation of significant factors on tear strength of cotton fabric for single step fixation of reactive printing and easy care finishing has been carried out in this research work using experimental design technique. The potential design factors were; concentration of reactive dye, concentration of crease resistant, fixation method and fixation temperature. The experiments were designed using DoE (Design of Experiment) and analyzed through software Design Expert. The detailed analysis of significant factors and interactions including ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), residuals, model accuracy and statistical model for tear strength has been presented. The interaction and contour plots of vital factors has been examined. It has been found from the statistical analysis that each factor has an interaction with other factor. Most of the investigated factors showed curvature effect on other factor. After critical examination of significant plots, quadratic model of tear strength with significant terms and their interaction at ? ? ? ? ? = 0.05 has been developed. The calculated correlation coefficient, R2 of the developed model is 0.9056. The high values of correlation coefficient inferred that developed equation of tear strength will precisely predict the tear strength over the range of values.",

However, very limited understanding\r\non the characteristics and behavior of this type of masonry walls, particularly from the perspective of the\r\nseismic design and assessment, is available. This paper attempts to investigate the important\r\ncharacteristics, such as strength and stiffness, of the walls constructed from two grades/types of these\r\nblocks, referred as Type-1 and Type-2 blocks.

Compressive strength, bond strength, coefficient\r\nof friction, and diagonal (shear)strength of the masonry blocks and its assemblages are obtained from\r\ndetailed experimental work. In the due course, the influence of the presence of the plaster on the masonry\r\nprisms made of two and three blocks subjected to compression and shear force respectively are investigated.\r\nThe outcomes of the experimental investigation presented herein can be used effectively in macro and\r\nmicro modelling of infill in framed structures as well as load bearing structures.",

The research was made on obstructions resembling weirs in an open channel. This weir-type obstruction was a representative of groyne/dike in a natural channel. The experimentation was performed in the laboratory for different values of inflow (25 l/sec and 40 l/sec), weir with and without vegetation and with different leeward slopes of the weir (1:4 and 1:7). The results were obtained for Reynolds normal stresses, longitudinal and vertical velocities. A comparison was made between the results of 1:4 and 1:7 leeward slope ratios. The data was collected with a LDA (Laser Doppler Anemometer). The vegetation was modeled with vertical circular rods placed over the crest of the weir. The blockage area due to this vegetation was 25% of the total area. The velocity data was gathered at around ten locations both at upstream and downstream the weir to get an insight into the flow structure. The results have been presented in the shape of vertical profiles both for velocities as well as Reynolds stresses at different locations of the channel.",
        "Communication systems which support 3D (Three Dimensional) audio offer a couple of advantages to the users/customers. Firstly, within the virtual acoustic environments all participants could easily be recognized through their placement/sitting positions. Secondly, all participants can turn their focus on any particular talker when multiple participants start talking at the same time by taking advantage of the natural listening tendency which is called the Cocktail Party Effect. On the other hand, 3D audio is known as a decreasing factor for overall speech quality because of the commencement of reverberations and echoes within the listening environment. In this article, we study the tradeoff between speech quality and human natural ability of localizing audio events/or talkers within our three dimensional audio supported telephony and teleconferencing solution. Further, we performed subjective user studies by incorporating two different HRTFs (Head Related Transfer Functions), different placements of the teleconferencing participants and different layouts of the virtual environments. Moreover, subjective user studies results for audio event localization and subjective speech quality are presented in this article. This subjective user study would help the research community to optimize the existing 3D audio systems and to design new 3D audio supported teleconferencing solutions based on the quality of experience requirements of the users/customers for agriculture personal in particular and for all potential users in general.",

The present study was conducted to estimate the wheat cropped area and crop yield in Hyderabad District, Pakistan from the Landsat 8 satellite imagery for Rabi 2013-14 and ground trothing. The required imagery of district Hyderabad was acquired from GLOVIS and was classified with maximum likelihood algorithm using ArcGIS 10.1. The classified image revealed that in district Hyderabad wheat covered 10,210 hectares (9.74% of total area) during Rabi season 2013-14 against 15,000 hectares (14.3% of total area) reported by Crop reporting Services (CRS), Sindh which is 30% less than that of reported by CRS. A positive linear relation between the wheat crop yield and the peak NDVI with coefficient of determination R2 = 0.91 was observed. Crop area and yield forecast through remote sensing is easy, cost effective, quick and reliable hence this technology needs to be introduced and propagated in the concerned government departments of Pakistan",
        "The socio-cultural value of open spaces normally refers to the behavior of users towards their surroundings. In the city of DGK (Dera Ghazi Khan), the wooden cots (locally known as Hamachas) are placed at almost every chowk and pathway. The Hamacha culture of the city acts as means of social interaction in the neighborhood where the people discuss personal, political and social issues in a friendly environment. This paper presents the social and cultural value of urban open spaces, specifically the placement of Hamachas in the public squares of the city. For this research, around 200 interviews with locals were conducted to gauge the role of public open spaces in shaping the culture of the city. The satisfaction index reveals that a vast majority of the users are highly satisfied with these public open spaces. The paper concludes that the use of Hamachas in open spaces plays a vital role in strengthening social ties among the locals. Other than a means for social interaction, these spaces are used for multiple activities ranging from conflict resolution to crime control. The findings of this study may be useful for future planning and design of squares/chowks and other public open spaces in other places ",

        "Day lighting is a useful and effective source of energy savings and visual comforts in buildings. Occupants expect good daylight in their living spaces for better living environment. The quality and quantity of natural light entering in to a building depend on both internal and external factors. Daylight strategies basically depend on the accessibility of natural light that is determined by the latitude of the building site and the conditions surrounding the building. Daylight provides lighting energy and energy demand reduction during peak utility hours. Bringing daylight into a building that displaces electric lighting and provides sufficient illumination is the greenest way to light a building presently. This research, aims at analyzing the daylight intensity in residential buildings in Cantonment Cottages Multan which is one of the hottest and progresse city of Pakistan. The intensity of daylight can be expressed in the terms of luminance and daylight factor. In this research, the 5 and 7 marla houses in Cantt Cottages in Multan were selected. The  device lux meter was used for measuring intensity with which the brightness appears to the human eye. The readings were taken by placing Lux Meter at the center and near windows in each building component at 2-4 pm. Inorderto evaluate the daylight intensity, the measured luminance in each component of building is compared with the standard illuminance as per recommendation of CIBSE (Chartered Institute of Building Service Engineers). After investigation, it has been found that daylight factor is much higher than the standard values",
        "In several regions of the Pakistan, crop cultivation is leading to the production crop residues and its disposal problems. It has been suggested that the co-digestion of the crop residues with the buffalo dung might be a disposal way for the wasted portion of the crops' residue. The objective of present study was to optimize the anaerobic co-digestion of canola straw and the buffalo dung through batch experiments in order to obtain maximum methane production. The optimization was carried out in three stages. In first stage, the best canola straw to buffalo dung ratio was evaluated. In second stage, the best concentration of sodium hydrogen carbonate was assessedas the alkaline pretreatment chemical, whereas in the third stage most suitable particle size of the canola strawwas evaluated. The assessment criteria for the optimization of a co-digestion were cumulative methane production and ABD (Anaerobic Biodegradability). The results yield that anaerobic co-digestibility of the canola straw and the buffalo dung is obviously influenced by all the three factors of optimization. The maximum methane production was obtained as 911 NmL from the canola straw to buffalo dung ratio of 40:60, the alkaline doze of 0.6 gNaHCO3 / gVS and canola straw particle size of 2mm. However, because of the higher shredding cost to produce 2mm sized canola straw, particle size 4mm could be the best canola straw particle size. ",
        "Vibration-based EH (Energy Harvesting) using piezoelectric materials have been investigated by several\r\nresearch groups with the aim of harvesting maximum energy and providing power to low-powered wireless\r\nelectronic systems for their entire operational life. The main areas of research includes improvements\r\nin mathematical modelling, optimization of harvester geometry, developments in electrical circuitry,\r\nadvancements in charge storage devices and investigating various piezoelectric materials to achieve\r\nmaximum power output. This paper investigates and compares the electrical power output with whole\r\nlength electrodes and with segmentation of electrodes for the same harvester length. It is found that the\r\nvoltage generated by one electrode of length l/2 of the direction-fixed tip system is significantly greater\r\nthan that produced by one electrode of length l of the free tip system. This paper also verifies the fact that\r\nsegmentation of electrodes reduces the effect of strain nodes and charge cancellation particularly at\r\nhigher mode frequencies. The paper presents the simulation results using DSM (Dynamic Stiffness\r\nMatrix) which is a compact method of modelling piezoelectric beams",
        "Compute intensive programs generally consume significant fraction of execution time in a small amount of repetitive code. Such repetitive code is commonly known as hotspot code. We observed that compute intensive hotspots often possess exploitable loop level parallelism. A JIT (Just-in-Time) compiler profiles a running program to identify its hotspots. Hotspots are then translated into native code, for efficient execution. Using similar approach, we propose a methodology to identify hotspots and exploit their parallelization potential on multicore systems. Proposed methodology selects and parallelizes each DOALL loop that is either contained in a hotspot method or calls a hotspot method. The methodology could be integrated in front-end of a JIT compiler to parallelize sequential code, just before native translation. However, compilation to native code is out of scope of this work. As a case study, we analyze eighteen JGF (Java Grande Forum) benchmarks to determine parallelization potential of hotspots. Eight benchmarks demonstrate a speedup of up to 7.6x on an 8-core system",
        "In this paper, the energy estimates for a damped linear homogeneous beam-like equation will be considered.\r\nThe energy estimates will be studied for different BCs (Boundary Conditions) for the axially moving\r\ncontinuum. The problem has physical and engineering application. The applications are mostly occurring\r\nin models of conveyor belts and band-saw blades. The research study is focused on the Dirichlet, the\r\nNeumann and the Robin type of BCs. From physical point of view, the considered mathematical model\r\nexpounds the transversal vibrations of a moving belt system or moving band-saw blade. It is assumed that\r\na viscous damping parameter and the horizontal velocity are positive and constant. It will be shown in this\r\npaper that change in geometry or the physics of the boundaries can affect the stability properties of the\r\nsystem in general and stability depends on the axial direction of the motion. In all cases of the BCs, it will\r\nbe shown that there is energy decay due to viscous damping parameter and it will also be shown that in\r\nsome cases there is no conclusion whether the beam energy decreases or increases. The detailed physical\r\ninterpretation of all terms and expressions is provided and studied in detail.",
        "Delivering reliable services in service oriented architectures entails the underlying\r\nbasis of having communication network models and well structured systems. With the\r\nrapid proliferation of ad-hoc mode of communication the reliable delivery of services\r\nincreasingly encounter new communication and network perturbations. Empirically\r\nthe core of service delivery in WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks) is information\r\ntransport from the sensor nodes to the sink node where the service resides. In this\r\nwork we provide a reliable information transport for enhanced service delivery by\r\nusing spatio-temporal correlation in WSN. The classification for different types of\r\ninformation required by the services is also presented. To overcome dynamic network\r\nconditions and evolving service requirements an adaptive retransmission mechanism\r\nbased on spatial correlation is utilized. Simulation results show that the proposed\r\nsolutions provide service specific reliability and save expensive retransmissions and\r\nthus provide energy efficient solution.",
        "This study introduces the effect of the thickness of a bacterial cellulose membrane by comparing the bone regeneration effect on rat skulls when using a collagen membrane and different thicknesses of resorbable bacterial cellulose membranes for guided bone regeneration. Barrier membranes of 0.10 mm, 0.15 mm, and 0.20 mm in thickness were made using bacterial cellulose produced as microbial fermentation metabolites. Mechanical strength was investigated, and new bone formation was evaluated through animal experimental studies. Experimental animals were sacrificed after having 2 weeks and 8 weeks of recovery, and specimens were processed for histologic and histomorphometric analyses measuring the area of bone regeneration (%) using an image analysis program. In 2 weeks, bone-like materials and fibrous connective tissues were observed in histologic analysis. In 8 weeks, all experimental groups showed the arrangement of osteoblasts surrounding the supporting body on the margin and center of the bone defect region. However, the amount of new bone formation was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) in bacterial cellulose membrane with 0.10 mm in thickness compared to the other experimental groups. Within the limitations of this study, a bacterial cellulose membrane with 0.10 mm thickness induced the most effective bone regeneration.",
        "A comparing study on formation and microstructure features of aluminum titanate is investigated through both solid-state and sol-gel processes. Aluminum titanate formed by firing at 1350ºC and 1450ºC for 4h in solid-state process. In the sol-gel process formation of submicron sized particles is followed by addition of sucrose into the transparent sol. XRD analysis was confirmed the formation of aluminum titanate at 1400ºC  in lower duration of calcination (3h) without any additives in the sol-gel process. In this work 2wt% MgO is added to the samples as the additive for forming acceleration of aluminum titanate. The influence of MgO addition and heat treatment are studied on phase formation and microstructure development of aluminum titanate in both procedures. Additive optimizes aluminum titanate formation at lower temperatures (1300-1350ºC). Phase and microstructure studies of Mg containing samples optimally show significance in aluminum titanate formation.",
        "Model output statistics (MOS) methods can be used to empirically relate an environmental variable of interest to predictions\r\nfrom earth system models (ESMs). This variable often belongs to a spatial scale not resolved by the ESM. Here, using the linear\r\nmodel fitted by least squares, we regress monthly mean streamflow of the Rhine River at Lobith and Basel against seasonal\r\npredictions of precipitation, surface air temperature, and runoff from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.\r\nTo address potential effects of a scale mismatch between the ESM's horizontal grid resolution and the hydrological application,\r\nthe MOS method is further tested with an experiment conducted at the subcatchment scale. This experiment applies the MOS method\r\nto 133 additional gauging stations located within the Rhine basin and combines the forecasts from the subcatchments to predict\r\nstreamflow at Lobith and Basel. In doing so, the MOS method is tested for catchments areas covering 4 orders of magnitude.\r\nUsing data from the period 1981–2011, the results show that skill, with respect to climatology, is restricted on average to\r\nthe first month ahead. This result holds for both the predictor combination that mimics the initial conditions and the\r\npredictor combinations that additionally include the dynamical seasonal predictions. The latter, however, reduce the mean\r\nabsolute error of the former in the range of 5 to 12 %, which is consistently reproduced at the subcatchment scale.\r\nAn additional experiment conducted for 5-day mean streamflow indicates that the dynamical predictions help to reduce\r\nuncertainties up to about 20 days ahead, but it also reveals some shortcomings of the present MOS method.",
        "One of the main challenges for global hydrological modelling is the limited\navailability of observational data for calibration and model verification.\nThis is particularly the case for real-time applications. This problem could\npotentially be overcome if discharge measurements based on satellite data\nwere sufficiently accurate to substitute for ground-based measurements. The\naim of this study is to test the potentials and constraints of the remote\nsensing signal of the Global Flood Detection System for converting the flood\ndetection signal into river discharge values.\n<br><br>\nThe study uses data for 322 river measurement locations in Africa, Asia,\nEurope, North America and South America. Satellite discharge measurements\nwere calibrated for these sites and a validation analysis with in situ\ndischarge was performed. The locations with very good performance will be\nused in a future project where satellite discharge measurements are obtained\non a daily basis to fill the gaps where real-time ground observations are\nnot available. These include several international river locations in\nAfrica: the Niger, Volta and Zambezi rivers.\n<br><br>\nAnalysis of the potential factors affecting the satellite signal was based\non a classification decision tree (random forest) and showed that mean\ndischarge, climatic region, land cover and upstream catchment area are the\ndominant variables which determine good or poor performance of the\nmeasure\\-ment sites. In general terms, higher skill scores were obtained for\nlocations with one or more of the following characteristics: a river width\nhigher than 1km; a large floodplain area and in flooded forest, a\npotential flooded area greater than 40%; sparse vegetation, croplands or\ngrasslands and closed to open and open forest; leaf area index > 2;\ntropical climatic area; and without hydraulic infrastructures. Also,\nlocations where river ice cover is seasonally present obtained higher skill\nscores. This work provides guidance on the best locations and limitations for\nestimating discharge values from these daily satellite signals.",
        "The shaped charge tandem warhead is an effective weapon against the ERA (explosive reactive armor). Whether the pre-warhead can reliably initiate the ERA directly determines the entire performance of the tandem warhead. The existing shaped charge pre-warhead mostly adopts a metal shaped jet, which effectively initiates the ERA, but interferes the main shaped jet. This article, on the other hand, explores the possibility of producing a pre-warhead using a low-density material as the liner. The nonlinear dynamic analysis software Autodyn-2D is used to simulate and compare three kinds of low-density shaped jets, including floatglass, Lucite, and Plexiglas, to the copper shaped jet in the effectiveness of impacting ERA. Based on the integrative criteria (including u-d initiation criterion, explosive reactive degree, explosive pressure, and particle velocity of the panels), it can be determined whether the low-density shaped jet can reliably initiate the sandwich charge. The results show that the three kinds of low-density shaped jets can not only initiate the reaction armor, but are also superior to the existing copper shaped jet in ductility, jet tip velocity, jet tip diameter, and the mass; namely, it is feasible to use the low-density material shaped jet to destroy the ERA.",
        "Dentistry is the area of medical sciences that is most resistant to the introduction of the novel methods arisen from the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology in the last 20 years.  Without moving on to science fiction like views pointing to times far ahead in the future, we show that the available nanoscale devices and processes of current science and technology, partly inherited from the areas of microscopy and microelectronics, have already proven to be useful for research and development in different fields of dental research.  To this goal, we review some results obtained in the last few years at our Institute in the area of dental materials and their characterization, which showed successful application of our background in microscopy and nanoengineering.",
        "Silicon nanowire-based field-effect transistors (SiNW FETs) have demonstrated the ability of ultrasensitive detection of a wide range of biological and chemical targets. The detection is based on the variation of the conductance of a nanowire channel, which is caused by the target substance. This is seen in the voltage–current behavior between the drain and source. Some current, known as leakage current, flows between the gate and drain, and affects the current between the drain and source. Studies have shown that leakage current is frequency dependent. Measurements of such frequency characteristics can provide valuable tools in validating the functionality of the used transistor. The measurements can also be an advantage in developing new detection technologies utilizing SiNW FETs. The frequency-domain responses can be measured by using a commercial sine-sweep-based network analyzer. However, because the analyzer takes a long time, it effectively prevents the development of most practical applications. Another problem with the method is that in order to produce sinusoids the signal generator has to cope with a large number of signal levels. This may become challenging in developing low-cost applications. This paper presents fast, cost-effective frequency-domain methods with which to obtain the responses within seconds. The inverse-repeat binary sequence (IRS) is applied and the admittance spectroscopy between the drain and source is computed through Fourier methods. The methods is verified by experimental measurements from an n-type SiNW FET.",
        "Al2O3 films were prepared by the aerosol deposition method at room temperature using different carrier gas compositions. The layers were deposited on alumina substrates and the film stress of the layer was calculated by measuring the deformation of the substrate. It was shown that the film stress can be halved by using oxygen instead of nitrogen or helium as the carrier gas. The substrates were annealed at different temperature steps to gain information about the temperature dependence of the reduction of the implemented stress. Total relaxation of the stress can already be achieved at 300 °C.  The XRD pattern shows crystallite growth and reduction of microstrain while annealing.",
        "The clustering of electricity customers might have an effective meaning if, and only if, it is verified by domain experts. Most of the previous studies on customer clustering, however, do not consider real applications, but only the structure of clusters. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the clustering results are applicable to real domains.  In other words, the results might not coincide with those of domain experts. In this paper, we focus on formulating clusters that are applicable to real applications based on domain expert knowledge. More specifically, we try to define a distance between customers that generates clusters that are applicable to demand response applications. First, the k-sliding distance, which is a new distance between two electricity customers, is proposed for customer clustering. The effect of k-sliding distance is verified by expert knowledge. Second, a genetic programming framework is proposed to automatically determine a more improved distance measure. The distance measure generated by our framework can be considered as a reflection of the clustering principles of domain experts. The results of the genetic programming demonstrate the possibility of deriving clustering principles.",
        "Previous research has shown that composite shape-stabilized phase change material (CPCM) has a remarkable capacity for thermal storage and stabilization, and it can be directly applied to highway construction without leakage. However, recent studies on temperature changing behaviors of CPCM and asphalt mixture cannot intuitively reflect the thermoregulation mechanism and efficiency of CPCM on asphalt mixture. The objective of this paper is to determine the specific heat capacity of CPCM and asphalt mixtures mixed with CPCM using the heat exchange system and the data acquisition system. Studies have shown that the temperature-rise curve of 5 °C CPCM has an obvious temperature plateau, while an asphalt mixture mixed with 5 °C CPCM does not; with increasing temperature, the specific heat capacities of both 5 °C CPCM and asphalt mixture first increase and then decrease, while the variation rate of 5 °C CPCM is larger than that of the asphalt mixture, and the maximum specific heat capacity of 5 °C CPCM appears around the initial phase change temperature. It is concluded that the temperature intervals of 5 °C CPCM are −18 °C–7 °C, 7 °C–25 °C and 25 °C–44 °C, respectively, and that of the asphalt mixture are −18 °C~10 °C, −10 °C~5 °C and 5 °C~28 °C. A low dosage of 5 °C CPCM has little influence on the specific heat capacity of asphalt mixture. Finally, the functions of specific heat capacities and temperature for CPCM and asphalt mixture mixed with CPCM were recommended by the sectional regression method.",
        "Germanane, a hydrogen-terminated graphane analogue of germanium has generated interest as a potential 2D electronic material. However, the incorporation and retention of extrinsic dopant atoms in the lattice, to tune the electronic properties, remains a significant challenge. Here, we show that the group-13 element Ga and the group-15 element As, can be successfully doped into a precursor CaGe<sub>2</sub> phase, and remain intact in the lattice after the topotactic deintercalation, using HCl, to form GeH. After deintercalation, a maximum of 1.1% As and 2.3% Ga can be substituted into the germanium lattice. Electronic transport properties of single flakes show that incorporation of dopants leads to a reduction of resistance of more than three orders of magnitude in H<sub>2</sub>O-containing atmosphere after As doping. After doping with Ga, the reduction is more than six orders of magnitude, but with significant hysteretic behavior, indicative of water-activation of dopants on the surface. Only Ga-doped germanane remains activated under vacuum, and also exhibits minimal hysteretic behavior while the sheet resistance is reduced by more than four orders of magnitude. These Ga- and As-doped germanane materials start to oxidize after one to four days in ambient atmosphere. Overall, this work demonstrates that extrinsic doping with Ga is a viable pathway towards accessing stable electronic behavior in graphane analogues of germanium.",
        "In this paper the effect of the Origanum aetheroleum - essential oil on the production growth and health of broiler chickens in conditions of welfare was studied. The animals had a free access to feedstuff and water. The experiment was carried out in 2 cycles on broiler types Ross 308 and Cobb 500. The viability, welfare and the body weight of broiler chickens at the end of each cycle was detected. The breeding was kept in the terms of welfare. The viability in trial groups (fed with feedstuff enriched with Origanum aetheroleum - essential oil was 100% while in the control groups the viability was 98% in first cycle carried out on Ross 308 and 98% in the second cycle carried out on Cobb 500. The average body weight of chickens at the end of the first cycle in control group was 1376.80 g while the average body weight of chickens at the end of the first cycle in trial group was 1767.2 g. The differences between these two groups were highly significant (P0.05). The average body weight of chickens at the end of the second cycle in control group was 1589.6 g while the average body weight of chickens at the end of the second cycle in trial group was 1567.2 g. The difference between these two groups was not significant (P0.05).",
        "Existing literature on education and technology has frequently highlighted the usefulness of online discussion forums for distance courses; however, the majority of such investigations have focused their attention only on text-based forums. The objective of this paper is to determine if the embedding of streamed videos in online discussion forums generates educational dialogue and consequently the feedback that students need in a Management Accounting Course. The findings suggest some interesting issues, such as: students prefer text answers except in complex questions, and videos never replace text commentaries and explanations, but rather complement them.",
        "In this paper, a real time sliding mode control scheme for a variable speed wind turbine that incorporates a doubly feed induction generator is described. In this design, the so-called vector control theory is applied, in order to simplify the system electrical equations. The proposed control scheme involves a low computational cost and therefore can be implemented in real-time applications using a low cost Digital Signal Processor (DSP). The stability analysis of the proposed sliding mode controller under disturbances and parameter uncertainties is provided using the Lyapunov stability theory. A new experimental platform has been designed and constructed in order to analyze the real-time performance of the proposed controller in a real system. Finally, the experimental validation carried out in the experimental platform shows; on the one hand that the proposed controller provides high-performance dynamic characteristics, and on the other hand that this scheme is robust with respect to the uncertainties that usually appear in the real systems.",
        "Additive manufacturing (AM), nowadays commonly known as 3D printing, is a revolutionary materials processing technology, particularly suitable for the production of low-volume parts with high shape complexities and often with multiple functions. As such, it holds great promise for the fabrication of patient-specific implants. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in implementing AM in the bio-fabrication field. This paper presents an overview on the state-of-the-art AM technology for bone tissue engineering (BTE) scaffolds, with a particular focus on the AM scaffolds made of metallic biomaterials. It starts with a brief description of architecture design strategies to meet the biological and mechanical property requirements of scaffolds. Then, it summarizes the working principles, advantages and limitations of each of AM methods suitable for creating porous structures and manufacturing scaffolds from powdered materials. It elaborates on the finite-element (FE) analysis applied to predict the mechanical behavior of AM scaffolds, as well as the effect of the architectural design of porous structure on its mechanical properties. The review ends up with the authors’ view on the current challenges and further research directions.",
        "LPV (Linear Parameter Varying) system is an important class of system, as it covers many physical systems. In the existing design theory related to control system, the major part is related to linear and non-linear systems. However, the LPV system is getting prominence and hence is an attractive area of research. Control issues linked with LPV systems are an emerging area of modern research. To investigate the control of this predominant class, the idea of observer design has been carried out in this article. In this paper, an observer based on RKF (Routine KalmanFiltering) scheme and LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) is employed for a set of linear parameter variations. The state and gain matrices are scheduled using an interpolation method, which is linear according to each parameter and is expected to be non-linear globally. For stability of observer, bound on rate of parameter variation is imposed. For simulation purpose, a real life case study of Boeing-747 is adopted. The proposed scheme is implemented for the stated LPV system. All the associated states of the system are examined with and without observer. Results obtained in this work show better performance as manifested by errors. Error in measurement is much reduced by employing this scheme. Short-listed features are presented in this paper to comprehend the performance of observer.",
        "In this work, some amide compounds with different aromatic substituent headgroups were synthesized and their gelation self-assembly behaviors in 22 solvents were characterized as new gelators. The obtained results indicated that the size of aromatic substituent headgroups in molecular skeletons in gelators showed crucial effect in the gel formation and self-assembly behavior of all compounds in the solvents used. Larger aromatic headgroups in molecular structures in the synthesized gelator molecules are helpful to form various gel nanostructures. Morphological investigations showed that the gelator molecules can self-assembly and stack into various organized aggregates with solvent change, such as wrinkle, belt, rod, and lamella-like structures. Spectral characterizations suggested that there existed various weak interactions including π-π stacking, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic forces due to aromatic substituent headgroups and alkyl substituent chains in molecular structures. In addition, the drug release capacities experiments demonstrated that the drug release rate in present obtained gels can be tuned by adjusting the concentrations of dye. The present work would open up enormous insight to design and investigate new kind of soft materials with designed molecular structures and tunable drug release performance.",
        "Precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) are an established ex vivo alternative to in vivo experiments in pharmacotoxicology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of PCLS as a tool in nanotoxicology studies. Silver (Ag-NPs) and zinc oxide (ZnO-NPs) nanoparticles as well as quartz particles were used because these materials have been previously shown in several in vitro and in vivo studies to induce a dose-dependent cytotoxic and inflammatory response. PCLS were exposed to three concentrations of 70 nm monodisperse polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated Ag-NPs under submerged culture conditions in vitro. ZnO-NPs (NM110) served as ‘soluble’ and quartz particles (Min-U-Sil) as ‘non-soluble’ control particles. After 4 and 24 h, the cell viability and the release of proinflammatory cytokines was measured. In addition, multiphoton microscopy was employed to assess the localization of Ag-NPs in PCLS after 24 h of incubation. Exposure of PCLS to ZnO-NPs for 4 and 24 h resulted in a strong decrease in cell viability, while quartz particles had no cytotoxic effect. Moreover, only a slight cytotoxic response was detected by LDH release after incubation of PCLS with 20 or 30 µg/mL of Ag-NPs. Interestingly, none of the particles tested induced a proinflammatory response in PCLS. Finally, multiphoton microscopy revealed that the Ag-NP were predominantly localized at the cut surface and only to a much lower extent in the deeper layers of the PCLS. In summary, only ‘soluble’ ZnO-NPs elicited a strong cytotoxic response. Therefore, we suggest that the cytotoxic response in PCLS was caused by released Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions rather than by the ZnO-NPs themselves. Moreover, Ag-NPs were predominantly localized at the cut surface of PCLS but not in deeper regions, indicating that the majority of the particles did not have the chance to interact with all cells present in the tissue slice. In conclusion, our findings suggest that PCLS may have some limitations when used for nanotoxicology studies. To strengthen this conclusion, however, other NP types and concentrations need to be tested in further studies.",
        "During the past decades, it became obvious that reactive oxygen species (ROS) exert a multitude of biological effects covering a wide spectrum that ranges from physiological regulatory functions to damaging alterations participating in the pathogenesis of increasing number of diseases. This review summarizes the key roles played by the ROS in both health and disease. ROS are metabolic products arising from various cells; two cellular organelles are intimately involved in their production and metabolism, namely, the endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondria. Updates on research that tremendously aided in confirming the fundamental roles of both organelles in redox regulation will be discussed as well. Although not comprehensive, this review will provide brief perspective on some of the current research conducted in this area for better understanding of the ROS actions in various conditions of health and disease.",
        "An ordinary state-based peridynamic formulation is developed to analyse cubic polycrystalline materials for the first time in the literature. This new approach has the advantage that no constraint condition is imposed on material constants as opposed to bond-based peridynamic theory. The formulation is validated by first considering static analyses and comparing the displacement fields obtained from the finite element method and ordinary state-based peridynamics. Then, dynamic analysis is performed to investigate the effect of grain boundary strength, crystal size, and discretization size on fracture behaviour and fracture morphology.",
        "Wireless sensor networks have attracted attention of researchers considering their abundant applications. One of the important issues in this network is limitation of energy consumption which is directly related to life of the network. One of the main works which have been done recently to confront with this problem is clustering. In this paper, an attempt has been made to present clustering method which performs clustering in two stages. In the first stage, it specifies candidate nodes for being head cluster with fuzzy method and in the next stage, the node of the head cluster is determined among the candidate nodes with cellular learning automata. Advantage of the clustering method is that clustering has been done based on three main parameters of the number of neighbors, energy level of nodes and distance between each node and sink node which results in selection of the best nodes as a candidate head of cluster nodes. Connectivity of network is also evaluated in the second part of head cluster determination. Therefore, more energy will be stored by determining suitable head clusters and creating balanced clusters in the network and consequently, life of the network increases.",
        "Block copolymers (BCPs) can create various morphology by self-assembly in bulk or film. Recently, using BCPs in confined geometries such as thin film (one-dimension), cylindrical template (two-dimension), or emulsion droplet (three-dimension), nanostructured BCP particles have been prepared, in which unique nanostructures of the BCP are formed via solvent annealing process and can be controlled depending on molecular weight ratio and interaction parameter of the BCPs, and droplet size. Moreover, by tuning interfacial property of the BCP particles, anisotropic particles with unique nanostructures have been prepared. Furthermore, for practical application such as drug delivery system, sensor, self-healing, metamaterial, and optoelectronic device, functional nanoparticles can be incorporated inside BCP particles. In this article, we summarize recent progress on the production of structured BCP particles and composite particles with metallic nanoparticles.",
        "The communication system that is presently applied in the European Train Control System can only support data exchange between vehicles and ground, but the direct vehicle-to-vehicle communication is not available. The details of interlocking information and other vehicles’ movements are invisible to drivers who are the last defense to prevent unsafe scenarios. As connected vehicles have been envisioned to enhance transportation efficiency and improve safety, the direct vehicle-to-vehicle communication network is involved in this paper to increase the safety of railway transport. In this paper, a new train movement authority (MA+) is proposed. Apart from a wireless communication unit, this system does not require any other infrastructure. With the assistance of vehicle-centric communication technology, MA+ can detect the condition of switches and trains within a certain scope. In this paper, the system structure of MA+ is proposed. Additionally, different implementation scenarios are also discussed. The detection range is estimated and validated based on mathematical calculation and experimental equations. An application demo of MA+ is presented on the Driver Machine Interface of the onboard equipment. The results indicate that MA+ can be a flexible and scalable system for furthering the improvement of railway safety.",
        "The goal of the paper was to identify  - lactoglobulin gene polymorphism in bulls. The  - lactoglobulin (LGB) is expressed in milk and is important in the evaluation of milk production potential and butterfat and protein content. LGB is localized on bovine chromosome 11. The AA genotype of LGB is associated with higher milk yield, the BB genotype with higher fat and casein content and is more desirable for cheese making. The material involved 46 bulls (Slovak spotted breed – 41 bulls, Pinzgau breed – 3 bulls and Holstein breed – 2 bulls). Bovine genomic DNA was isolated from sperm using commercial kit NucleoSpin Tissue and used in order to estimate LGB genotypes by means of PCR RFLP method and high resolution melting analysis (HRMA). In the population of Slovak spotted breed we detected all genotypes AA, AB and BB with frequency 0.3415, 0.4390 and 0.2195, subsequently. In Pinzgau breed was detected homozygote genotypes AA and BB with frequency 0.3333 and 0.6667. In Holstein breed was observed only heterozygote genotype AB with frequency 1.",
        "This study investigates the emissions of various industrial facilities under start-up, shut-down, and normal operations. The industries that have been investigated include power and/or heat generation, energy-from-waste generation, nuclear power generation, sulphuric acid production, ethylene production, petrochemical production, and waste incineration. The study investigated multiple facilities worldwide for each of these industrial categories. The different potential contaminants characteristic of each industry type have been investigated and the emissions of these contaminants under non-steady state have been compared to the steady state emissions. Where available, trends have been developed to identify the circumstances, i.e., the industrial sector and contaminant, under which the assessment and consideration of emissions from start-up and shut-down events is necessary for each industry. These trends differ by industrial sector and contaminant. For example, the study shows that sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions should be assessed for the start-up operations of sulphuric acid production plants, but may not need to be assessed for the start-up operations of a conventional power generation facility. The trends developed as part of this research paper will help air permit applicants to effectively allocate their resources when assessing emissions related to non-steady state operations. Additionally, it will ensure that emissions are assessed for the worst-case scenario. This is especially important when emissions under start-up and shut-down operations have the potential to exceed enforceable emission limits. Thus, assessing emissions for the worst-case scenario can help in preventing the emissions from adversely impacting public health and the environment.",
        "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Early detection of lung cancer is problematic due to the lack of a marker with high diagnosis sensitivity and specificity. To determine the differently expressed proteins in the serum of lung cancer and figure out the function of the proteins, two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) were used to screen the serum proteins of lung cancer model induced by 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA). From optimized 2DE image, 455 spots in the normal sera and 716 spots in the lung cancers sera were detected. Among them, 141 protein spots were differentially expressed when comparing the serum from normal rat and serum from lung cancer model, including 82 overexpressed proteins and 59 underexpressed proteins. Changes of haptoglobin, transthyretin, and TNF superfamily member 8 (TNFRS8) were confirmed in sera from lung cancer by MALDI-TOF-MS. Proteomics technology leads to identify changes of haptoglobin, transthyretin, and TNFRS8 in serum of rat lung cancer model and represents a powerful tool in searching for candidate proteins as biomarkers."
